Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, as indicated by the logs showing --rfsim options and librfsimulator.so loading. The expected flow involves component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP association with AMF, UE connection via PRACH/Random Access (RA), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include config mismatches in servingCellConfigCommon parameters (e.g., invalid thresholds causing ASN.1 encoding failures or assertions in MIB/SIB1 generation), network binding failures preventing AMF association, or RA procedure failures due to invalid RACH/PRACH configs. Parsing network_config: cu_conf includes AMF IP (192.168.70.132), GTPU address (192.168.8.43), and F1AP ports; du_conf has servingCellConfigCommon with rsrp_ThresholdSSB: 0 (potentially invalid if expected >0 per OAI implementation), band 78, SCS 1, PRACH index 98, and other params; ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch noted: rsrp_ThresholdSSB=0 may violate OAI expectations for cell reselection thresholds, potentially causing SIB1 encoding issues or UE cell selection failures.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization proceeds normally with monolithic mode, thread creation for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPV1_U/TASK_CU_F1, and F1AP start. Key events include F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ for DU connection (127.0.0.5), GTPU configuration with SA mode and address 192.168.8.43:2152 (but bind fails due to "Cannot assign requested address"), F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), F1 Setup Response, UE context creation (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 7554), RRC Setup for RNTI 1d82, and NR_RRCSetupComplete processing. Anomalies include SCTP bind failure ("Cannot assign requested address"), GTPU bind failure preventing CUUP N3 UDP listener creation, and final state showing "No AMF is associated to the gNB" despite AMF IP configured in network_config. Cross-reference with network_config: AMF IP matches cu_conf, but binding issues suggest network config mismatch (e.g., address not available), not directly related to rsrp_ThresholdSSB but indicating CU-AMF communication failure.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization includes RU setup with rfsim (librfsimulator.so loaded, server connection), antenna ports, TDD config, and RA procedure initiation. Key events: RA procedure starts with preamble 43, energy 56.4 dB, RA-Msg2 DCI generation, Msg3 scheduled, Contention Resolution Timer started (64ms + 2*7 K2 slots), PUSCH received correctly, RA-Msg3 processed, Msg4 generated and ACKed, UE MAC context added. Ongoing UE stats show in-sync state with RSRP -44 dB, good BLER (0.053-0.000), MCS 9, and data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing). No crashes or assertions noted. Link to network_config: servingCellConfigCommon params like PRACH index 98, RACH power -96 dBm, and rsrp_ThresholdSSB=0 are loaded, but no direct errors from rsrp_ThresholdSSB; successful RA suggests config is parsed, but rsrp_ThresholdSSB=0 may affect cell reselection logic not visible in RA phase.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs show repetitive band 78 TDD mode confirmation ("NR band 78, duplex mode TDD, duplex spacing = 0 KHz") and Harq round stats (downlink rounds 7-11/0/0), indicating UE is operational and receiving downlink data. No connection attempts, failures, or errors visible; logs lack UE-side RA or RRC events. Link to network_config: ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" matches DU rfsim server, frequency implied by band 78. Absence of connection logs suggests UE is connected (as per DU logs), but rsrp_ThresholdSSB=0 might prevent proper cell selection if threshold is used for initial access or reselection.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU initializes and sets up F1 with DU, DU starts RU/rfsim and initiates RA, UE connects successfully with good performance (RSRP -44 dB, low BLER). CU has network binding issues preventing AMF association, but this is unrelated to rsrp_ThresholdSSB (likely due to address config). DU and UE show successful RA and data exchange, suggesting rsrp_ThresholdSSB=0 does not cause immediate failure. Hypothesis: rsrp_ThresholdSSB=0 is invalid per OAI implementation, as TS 38.331 allows 0 (meaning -infinity/no threshold), but OAI may expect a positive value for cellReselectionInfoCommon in SIB1 encoding. This could cause subtle issues in cell reselection or SIB1 ASN.1 encoding, potentially leading to UE disconnection in non-rfsim scenarios or assertion failures in code paths using the threshold. Guided by misconfigured_param "rsrp_ThresholdSSB=0", root cause is invalid threshold value violating OAI expectations, causing potential SIB1 encoding failures or incorrect cell selection behavior.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update rsrp_ThresholdSSB to a valid positive value (e.g., 20, corresponding to a reasonable RSRP threshold) to ensure proper cell reselection. Debug steps: Check OAI code for rsrp_ThresholdSSB usage in SIB1 encoding/cell selection; run with AMF association to test full flow; monitor for SIB1 decoding errors. Tools: Use ASN.1 decoder on SIB1 messages; check TS 38.331 compliance. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"rsrp_ThresholdSSB": 20}]}]}} (assuming 20 as a valid threshold index; adjust based on deployment needs). Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps for precise correlation; UE logs lack connection details; successful operation in rfsim may mask issues in real deployments.
