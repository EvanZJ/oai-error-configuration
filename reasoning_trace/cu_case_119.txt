Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by UE logs showing rfsim client attempts and DU logs with rfsimulator server config. Expected flow: CU loads config, validates security params, initializes with GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup, DU connects via F1AP, F1AP setup completes, radio activates, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid security values causing early exits), preventing component init, leading to connection failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf.gNBs) has gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-CU", tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list with mcc=1/mnc=1/mnc_length=2/sst=1, nr_cellid=123456789, tr_s_preference="f1", local_s_if_name="lo", local_s_address="127.0.0.5", remote_s_address="127.0.0.3", local_s_portc=501, local_s_portd=2152, remote_s_portc=500, remote_s_portd=2152, SCTP_INSTREAMS/OUTSTREAMS=2, amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU="192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152, security with ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"], integrity_algorithms=["nia2","nia0"], drb_ciphering="invalid" (invalid string instead of "yes"/"no"), drb_integrity="no". ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: drb_ciphering="invalid" is invalid (should be "yes" or "no"), causing config validation error in logs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, but hits "bad drb_ciphering value 'invalid', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed" during config parsing, logs end abruptly. Anomalies: Immediate config validation failure, no threads or interfaces started. Cross-reference: Invalid drb_ciphering prevents CU from proceeding.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU loads config successfully, initializes RU threads, sets up rfsimulator, waits for gNB L1, RF ready, client connects (UE), but F1AP connect to CU 127.0.0.5 fails "Connection refused" repeatedly, retries association. No F1 setup, waits for response before radio activation. Anomalies: F1AP failures due to CU not running. Cross-reference: DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5, but CU config failed.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY for rfsim, configures HW cards, starts threads, runs as rfsim client, tries connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail errno(111) "Connection refused". Anomalies: Persistent connect failures. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches attempts, but server not started because DU not activated (no F1 setup).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU config parsing fails due to invalid drb_ciphering="invalid" (string not "yes"/"no"), causes validation error and early exit. DU starts but can't connect to CU via F1AP, retries fail. UE can't connect to rfsim server because DU waits for F1 setup, radio not activated. Timeline: CU fails immediately on config validation, DU/UE proceed but fail on connections. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "security.drb_ciphering=invalid" invalidates config file parsing in OAI RRC code, causing validation failure and early exit. This blocks CU init, cascading to F1AP/UE failures. Guided by misconfigured_param, root cause is invalid drb_ciphering value, per OAI security config validation (expects "yes" or "no"). No tools needed, logs/code patterns confirm.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change drb_ciphering from "invalid" to "yes" or "no" (e.g., "yes" to enable DRB ciphering). Debug: Check OAI RRC config parsing for security params, validate string values in docs. Tools: If spec details needed, search "3GPP TS 33.501 DRB ciphering configuration" or "OAI security.drb_ciphering parameter". Corrected config snippets: {"cu_conf": {"security": {"drb_ciphering": "yes"} /* Changed from invalid "invalid" to valid "yes" for DRB ciphering */}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}}.
