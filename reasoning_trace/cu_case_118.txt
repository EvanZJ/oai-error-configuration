Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by UE logs showing rfsim client connection and RA procedures, DU logs with rfsimulator server starting, and CU logs with SA mode GTPU. Expected flow: CU loads config, initializes with GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup, DU connects via F1AP, F1AP setup completes, radio activates, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session with AMF. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid IP values causing GTPU bind errors), preventing NGU setup, leading to AMF association failures despite F1AP success. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf.gNBs) has gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-CU", tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list with mcc=1/mnc=1/mnc_length=2/sst=1, nr_cellid=123456789, tr_s_preference="f1", local_s_if_name="lo", local_s_address="127.0.0.5", remote_s_address="127.0.0.3", local_s_portc=501, local_s_portd=2152, remote_s_portc=500, remote_s_portd=2152, SCTP_INSTREAMS/OUTSTREAMS=2, amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43", GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=12345 (invalid integer instead of IP string), GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=12345 is invalid (should be IPv4 string like "192.168.8.43"), causing GTPU setup failure in logs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, registers gNB[0] with NGAP (id 3584), sets up threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB. GTPU configures, SCTP bindx fails "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99, invalid NGU IP), SCTP socket open fails, GTPU configures address 127.0.0.1:2152 (fallback), GTPU instance 97, RRC enters main loop, accepts CU-UP ID 3584, F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU 3584, sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU, creates UE context CU UE ID 1 DU UE ID 63992 (rnti f9f8), activates SRB 1, generates RRCSetup, processes NR_RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. Anomalies: SCTP bind failure, GTPU fallback to 127.0.0.1, F1AP succeeds but ends with "No AMF is associated". Cross-reference: Invalid GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU prevents proper GTPU NGU binding.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, sets up rfsimulator, waits for gNB L1, RF ready, client connects (UE), RA procedure initiates with preamble 51, energy 56.4 dB, TC-RNTI f9f8, Msg2 DCI, Msg3 scheduled, contention resolution timer, Msg3 received, UE MAC context added, Msg4 generated, Msg4 Ack received, CBRA succeeded. Stats show UE in-sync, data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing), Harq rounds. No crash, successful RA/RRC connection. Anomalies: None apparent, DU operates normally. Cross-reference: DU at 127.0.0.3 connects to CU at 127.0.0.5, matches CU F1AP.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE shows NR band 78 TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz, Harq round stats for Downlink (increasing from 8 to 11), no explicit connection attempts (truncated), but implies ongoing connection with stats. Anomalies: Logs repetitive band info, no failures shown. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches DU server, connection successful as per DU logs.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU fails GTPU bind due to invalid GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=12345 (integer not string), cascades to SCTP socket failure, but GTPU falls back to 127.0.0.1 and succeeds, F1AP setup completes, DU connects, UE RA/RRC succeeds via rfsim. However, invalid NGU IP disrupts GTPU NGU setup, preventing AMF association via NGAP, hence "No AMF is associated", blocking PDU sessions despite RRC_CONNECTED. Timeline: CU GTPU bind fails, F1AP/UE proceed but NGAP stuck. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=12345" invalidates NGU IP parsing in libconfig/OAI code, causing bind failure (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address" for invalid addr). This blocks NGAP AMF association, per OAI param validation (expects IPv4 string). Guided by misconfigured_param, root cause is invalid GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU type (int vs string), similar to prior cases. No tools needed, logs/code patterns confirm.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU from 12345 to valid IPv4 string, e.g., "192.168.8.43" (matching GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF for consistency). Debug: Check OAI config_userapi.c for NETWORK_INTERFACES validation, use strace for GTPU socket calls. Tools: If spec details needed, search "3GPP TS 23.501 N3 interface IP configuration" or "OAI NETWORK_INTERFACES parameter". Corrected config snippets: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"NETWORK_INTERFACES": {"GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "192.168.8.43"} /* Changed from invalid int 12345 to valid IP string for NGU interface */}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}}.
