Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in the logs and the rfsimulator config in du_conf and ue_conf. The expected flow is: CU initializes threads and interfaces (SCTP for NGAP to AMF, GTPU for N3), DU initializes RU and MAC layers, F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connects via rfsim server for PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures causing socket bind errors (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address"), which prevent AMF association while allowing partial F1AP/GTPU fallback. The network_config's gnb_conf (from cu_conf) includes tracking_area_code=100000 (invalid, should be 0-65535 per 3GPP TS 23.003), AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43:2152; ue_conf has imsi 001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr 127.0.0.1:4043. Initial mismatch: tracking_area_code=100000 exceeds max 65535, likely causing libconfig validation or config corruption.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY, RRC, GTPU (SA mode, address 192.168.8.43:2152), threads for NGAP, GTPU, F1AP. Key events: NGAP registers gNB 3584, checks AMF state; SCTP bindx fails (errno 99), no SCTP connection; GTPU initializes UDP but fails bind ("bind: Cannot assign requested address"), can't create instance (id -1); F1AP starts successfully (socket for 127.0.0.5:10, assoc_id 543), receives F1 Setup Request from DU, responds, UE context created (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 16981, RNTI 4255), RRC SetupComplete processed, UE connected. Anomalies: SCTP/GTPU bind failures prevent N3 interface, leading to "No AMF is associated to the gNB" despite F1AP success. Cross-reference: network_config's cu_conf has tracking_area_code=100000, which may corrupt config or cause socket failure; AMF IP matches 192.168.70.132.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, loads librfsimulator, sets band 78, TDD, starts RF, connects UE client. RA procedure succeeds (preamble 36, Msg2/Msg3/Msg4), UE RNTI 4255 in-sync, stats show good BLER/SNR. No PHY/MAC errors or crashes; continues logging UE stats (Frame.Slot 128.0 to 896.0, increasing TX/RX bytes). Links to network_config: du_conf has prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 (valid), but no direct tracking_area_code issue here.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repeat NR band 78 TDD info, Harq stats (8/0/0 to 11/0/0), indicating successful connection and data exchange. No connection failures; seems stable post-RACH.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU fails SCTP/GTPU bind early, preventing AMF association, but F1AP succeeds (DU connects at assoc_id 543, UE RACH at frame 183.19), UE connects via rfsim (DU logs show client connect, RA success). Root cause: misconfigured_param "gNBs.tracking_area_code=100000" is invalid (max 65535 per 3GPP TS 23.003); this causes config corruption or validation failure, propagating to SCTP bindx() failure (errno 99), GTPU bind failure ("can't create GTP-U instance"), blocking NGAP AMF association while F1AP/GTPU fallback works partially. Hypothesis: Invalid tracking_area_code corrupts CU config, preventing proper socket setup for AMF, but DU/UE proceed via F1AP. No need for tools; based on logs (bind failures match invalid params) and OAI code patterns (config_userapi.c validates ranges, exits on invalid).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Update cu_conf gNBs.tracking_area_code to valid value like 1. Debug: Check OAI config validation logs for range errors; use strace on CU for socket calls. Tools: If needed, grep OAI code for tracking_area_code validation. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "tracking_area_code": 1
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {},
  "ue_conf": {}
}
