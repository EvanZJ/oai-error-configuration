Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by GTPU SA mode and UE rfsim client connection. Expected flow: CU initializes, binds GTPU/NGAP interfaces, connects to AMF via NGAP, sets up F1AP to DU, DU activates radio/rfsim server, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Invalid gNB_ID causing config validation failure, CU crash, F1AP failure, DU connection issues, UE rfsim connect failures. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has gNB_ID="invalid_hex" (string instead of hex), which matches misconfigured_param "gNBs.gNB_ID=invalid_hex". du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (mismatch with UE's 127.0.0.1). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch: Invalid gNB_ID likely causes config validation failure, CU crash.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads, starts F1AP at CU with gNB_CU_id[0] 0 (note: 0 instead of expected hex like 0xe00). Then "Assertion (config_isparamset(gnbParms, 0)) failed!", "gNB_ID is not defined in configuration file", "Exiting execution". Anomalous: CU crashes immediately due to invalid gNB_ID, no further init. Cross-reference: gNB_ID="invalid_hex" invalid, causes assertion in e1ap_setup.c.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes fully, starts F1AP at DU, tries SCTP connect to CU (127.0.0.5), but "Connect failed: Connection refused", retries many times, "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio". No crash, but stalls waiting for CU. Links to network_config: gNB_ID valid in du_conf.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, tries connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043, but "connect() failed, errno(111)" repeatedly. No connection, because DU hasn't activated rfsim (waiting for F1 Setup). Links to ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1".

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU crashes on invalid gNB_ID="invalid_hex" (not valid hex string), assertion fails in config validation. Timeline: CU exits → F1AP doesn't start → DU SCTP connect fails, retries, waits for F1 Setup → no rfsim server → UE connect fails. Hypothesis: gNB_ID must be valid hex string (e.g., "0xe00"); "invalid_hex" causes config_isparamset failure, CU exits, cascading to DU/UE failures. Guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.gNB_ID=invalid_hex", root cause is invalid gNB_ID causing CU config validation failure and crash.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set gNB_ID to valid hex string, e.g., "0xe00". Also fix du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr to "127.0.0.1". Debug: Check config parsing for gNB_ID; use grep_search on OAI for gNB_ID validation. Corrected configs:

{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "gNBs": {
        "gNB_ID": "0xe00"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
