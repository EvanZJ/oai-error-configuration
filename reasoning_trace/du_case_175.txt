Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, as indicated by --rfsim --sa options in DU logs and UE connecting to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043. Expected flow: CU initializes GTPU/NGAP/F1AP, DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC with MIMO config, starts rfsim server, UE connects for PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: MIMO layer config mismatches in DU (e.g., invalid maxMIMO_layers causing assertions), asserts in RCconfig_nr_macrlc(), DU crashes preventing rfsim server startup, UE connection failures. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU on 127.0.0.5:2152 (successful after initial fail). du_conf has gNB-Eurecom-DU with pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2, pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2, pusch_AntennaPorts=4, maxMIMO_layers=0 (misconfigured). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043, imsi=001010000000101. Initial mismatch: maxMIMO_layers=0 in du_conf, but must be >0 and <= total antenna ports.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads for NGAP/F1AP/GTPU, registers gNB[0], F1AP starts CU side, GTPU succeeds on 127.0.0.5:2152. Key events: Successful init, but no F1AP DU connection due to DU crash. Anomalies: GTPU bind fails initially (errno 99), but retries succeed; no DU setup, CU waits. No direct link to misconfigured param, but CU depends on DU for F1AP.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RC.gNB, L1 north init, MAC alloc, PHY callbacks, then logs "pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 2 pusch_AntennaPorts 4", "maxMIMO_Layers 0", then assertion: "Assertion (config.maxMIMO_layers != 0 && config.maxMIMO_layers <= tot_ant) failed!" with "Invalid maxMIMO_layers 0" in RCconfig_nr_macrlc() gnb_config.c:1261, exiting OAI softmodem. Break down: Init succeeds until MIMO config validation, where maxMIMO_layers=0 violates >0 requirement, causing assert and exit. Links to network_config: maxMIMO_layers=0 invalid for MIMO (must be 1-8 per OAI, depending on antennas).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY for gNB TXant=1, UE RXant=1, configures HW cards 0-7 for TDD at 3619200000 Hz, creates threads, loads RFSIMULATOR device, attempts connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly (errno 111 "Connection refused"). No successful connection, loops indefinitely. Links to network_config: rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043 matches attempts, but DU crash prevents server startup.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines: CU starts F1AP, DU inits and crashes immediately on MIMO assert, UE starts and loops on connect fails. Correlation: DU crash prevents F1AP completion and rfsim server start, causing UE connect failures; CU stalls without DU. Misconfigured param "gNBs[0].maxMIMO_layers=0" causes assert in RCconfig_nr_macrlc(), as maxMIMO_layers=0 not in 1-8 range (per OAI MIMO limits), leading to exit. Hypothesis: maxMIMO_layers=0 invalid for MIMO layers (range 1-8 depending on antennas), causes assert in MIMO config; OAI RCconfig_nr_macrlc() enforces maxMIMO_layers >0.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set maxMIMO_layers to 2 in du_conf gNBs[0], within valid range 1-8. This allows DU to proceed past MIMO validation, start rfsim server, UE connects. Debug: Check OAI gnb_config.c for MIMO layer limits; verify antenna port calculations. Further: Test with corrected config, monitor F1AP/NGAP for setup. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... (unchanged)}, "du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"maxMIMO_layers": 2, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {... (unchanged)}}. This fixes invalid maxMIMO_layers causing MIMO assert and DU crash.
