Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with monolithic NFAPI mode. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads, SCTP/F1AP/NGAP setup), DU starts rfsim server, UE connects to rfsim server, F1AP connection between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, UE performs PRACH/RACH, RRC connection, PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing errors (libconfig), invalid SCTP parameters violating RFC 4960 (e.g., SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 invalid, must be >=1), bind failures on network interfaces, or AMF association failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf/du_conf) has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"/"gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs with gNB_ID=0xe00, tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list (mcc=1,mnc=1), nr_cellid=1, SCTP/F1AP ports (local_s_address=127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3, remote_s_address=127.0.0.3/127.0.0.5), amf_ip_address=192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES (GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43), SCTP (SCTP_INSTREAMS=2/0 invalid, SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=2), servingCellConfigCommon with physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_frequencyBand=78, dl_carrierBandwidth=106, ul_carrierBandwidth=106, pMax=20, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, rsrp_ThresholdSSB=19, ssb_periodicityServingCell=2, ssPBCH_BlockPower=-25, etc. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, uicc0 (imsi=001010000000101), rfsimulator (serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043). Initial mismatch: SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 violates RFC 4960 minimum 1, likely causing SCTP association failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1), registers gNB[0] with gNB_CU_id=3584, checks AMF registration state. SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (errno 99: Cannot assign requested address), GTPU bind fails on 192.168.8.43:2152 (Cannot assign requested address), falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 for GTPU, creates gtpu instance id=97. F1AP starts at CU, creates SCTP socket for 127.0.0.5:10, initializes GTPU for 127.0.0.5:2152, accepts CU-UP ID 3584. Receives F1 Setup Request from DU 3584 (gNB-Eurecom-DU), sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU, creates UE context CU UE ID 1 DU UE ID 56768 (rnti: ddc0), activates SRB 1, generates RRCSetup, processes NR_RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. But then "No AMF is associated to the gNB" - indicates NGAP/SCTP to AMF failed. Anomalies: SCTP bind failures (interface issue), but main issue is AMF association failure despite F1AP success.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, waits for gNB L1 instances, configures RU (librfsimulator loaded), sets RU mask, initializes RU threads, configures ru_id 0, waits for sync, ALL RUs READY, initializes gNBs, sends sync to threads. RU rf device ready, generates void samples, command line params for UE, client connects, sends time. NR_MAC Frame.Slot progresses, initiates RA procedure (preamble 19, energy 56.4 dB), RA-RNTI 010b, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, Msg3 scheduled, RA Contention Resolution timer started, adds UE MAC Context RNTI ddc0, RA-Msg3 received, activates SRB 1, generates msg4, RA-Msg4 ack received, CBRA succeeded. UE stats show in-sync, RSRP -44, BLER decreasing, data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing). No crash or errors; DU fully operational, rfsim server running, UE connected and exchanging data.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, sets band 78 TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz, Harq round stats for Downlink (progressing from 8 to 11 rounds), no errors. Indicates successful connection to rfsim server, data exchange ongoing.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU initializes but SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (interface issue), falls back to loopback for GTPU/F1AP, successfully establishes F1AP with DU (F1 Setup Request/Response), UE connects via rfsim, RA succeeds, RRC connected, but "No AMF is associated" - NGAP/SCTP to AMF failed. DU fully operational, rfsim server running, UE connected and exchanging data (no issues). The misconfigured SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 in du_conf is invalid per RFC 4960 (must be >=1 for inbound streams), causing SCTP association setup failure for NGAP to AMF, preventing AMF association. F1AP succeeds because it uses separate SCTP config or loopback. Hypothesis: Invalid SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 violates RFC 4960, leads to SCTP association failure for AMF, CU cannot register with AMF, but DU/UE proceed via F1AP/rfsim. Guided by misconfigured_param, SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 is clearly invalid.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix SCTP_INSTREAMS to valid value >=1 (e.g., 2, matching cu_conf). Debug: Check SCTP logs, validate SCTP params against RFC 4960. Tools: Use SCTP diagnostic tools. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {... "gNBs": [{"SCTP": {"SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2, ...}}] ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}. This sets SCTP_INSTREAMS to 2 (valid), enabling AMF association.
