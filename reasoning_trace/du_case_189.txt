Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with CU and DU split architecture. The expected flow is CU initialization (NGAP, GTPU setup), DU initialization (PHY/MAC setup, RU configuration), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in servingCellConfigCommon RACH parameters, ASN.1 encoding failures, assertions in RACH config cloning, or connection failures due to invalid power ramping. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has servingCellConfigCommon with powerRampingStep: 0 (invalid, should be 1-6 for dB2-dB12 or enum values), preambleTransMax: 6, ra_ResponseWindow: 4, etc. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", serverport "4043". Initial mismatch: powerRampingStep=0 is invalid per 3GPP TS 38.331 (ENUMERATED {dB0, dB2, dB4, dB6}, but 0 may cause encoding issues in OAI).

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB. GTPU configures SA mode with address 192.168.8.43:2152 but bind fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU with RRC version 17.3.0. Decodes CCCH for UE RNTI e9f9, creates UE context, activates SRB1, generates RRCSetup, processes RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. No AMF association ("No AMF is associated"). Anomalies: GTPU bind failures due to IP issues, but F1AP succeeds, UE connects despite CU GTPU issues (likely due to rfsim not requiring real GTPU).

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, configures RU with librfsimulator.so, sets band 78, SCS 1, TDD. RU RF started, UE connects with command line -C 3619200000 -r 106 --numerology 1 --ssb 516. RA procedure initiates with preamble 39, energy 56.4 dB, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, Msg3 scheduled, RA-Msg3 received, CBRA succeeds, UE RNTI e9f9 connected. Ongoing stats show in-sync, RSRP -44, BLER low, TX/RX bytes increasing. No crash or assertion visible. Links to gnb_conf: servingCellConfigCommon powerRampingStep=0 used in RACH config, but RA succeeds on first attempt.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE runs in band 78 TDD mode, duplex spacing 0 KHz. Repeated Harq stats for downlink (7-11 rounds, 0 errors). No explicit connection attempts or failures shown, but implies ongoing communication. Links to ue_conf: rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1":4043 matches DU RU config.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU starts but GTPU bind fails, yet F1AP succeeds, DU starts RU, RA procedure completes successfully with UE connected. No DU crash or UE connect failure in logs, but misconfigured_param powerRampingStep=0 in servingCellConfigCommon is invalid. Per 3GPP TS 38.331, powerRampingStep ENUMERATED {dB0, dB2, dB4, dB6}, so 0=dB0 is technically valid, but in OAI NR configs, it's set to 1 (dB2), and 0 may cause issues in RACH config encoding/cloning. Hypothesis: powerRampingStep=0 causes assertion or failure in nr_rach_config() or ASN.1 encoding for RACH_ConfigGeneric, preventing DU from properly configuring RACH, leading to RA failures in real scenarios (though succeeds here due to AWGN channel). Correlates with previous cases where invalid RACH params (e.g., preambleTransMax=0) cause encoding asserts.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].powerRampingStep to 1 (dB2) for valid power ramping. Debug: Check OAI logs for "bad powerRampingStep" or ASN.1 encoding errors; run with noisy channel to test RA retransmissions. Tools: Use gdb on DU for RACH config asserts. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {...}, "du_conf": {... "servingCellConfigCommon": [{"powerRampingStep": 1, ...}]}, "ue_conf": {...}}.

Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps, GTPU bind failures may mask issues, UE logs repetitive without errors.
