Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with CU and DU split architecture. The expected flow is CU initialization (NGAP, GTPU setup), DU initialization (PHY/MAC setup, RU configuration), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connection via PRACH/RACH (Msg1 → RAR/Msg2 → Msg3 → Msg4), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in servingCellConfigCommon RACH parameters, invalid RA response window causing RAR scheduling failures, asserts in RACH config, or connection failures due to RA timeouts. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has servingCellConfigCommon with ra_ResponseWindow: 0 (invalid, should be 1-80 for sl1-sl80), preambleTransMax: 6, powerRampingStep: 1, etc. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", serverport "4043". Initial mismatch: ra_ResponseWindow=0 is invalid per 3GPP TS 38.331 (ENUMERATED {sl1, sl2, sl4, sl8, sl10, sl20, sl40, sl80}), causing RA window to be 0 slots.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB. GTPU configures SA mode with address 192.168.8.43:2152 but bind fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU with RRC version 17.3.0. No UE connection logs, as RA fails at DU. Anomalies: GTPU bind failures due to IP issues, but F1AP succeeds; no UE context creation, indicating RA failure prevents RRC setup.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, configures RU with librfsimulator.so, sets band 78, SCS 1, TDD. RU RF started, UE connects with command line -C 3619200000 -r 106 --numerology 1 --ssb 516. Repeated RA procedures: Initiates RA with preamble, energy detected, activates RA process, but immediately "exceeded RA window: preamble at X.19 now X+1.5 (diff 6), ra_ResponseWindow 0/1 slots", "cannot schedule Msg2". No RAR scheduled, RA fails repeatedly. Links to gnb_conf: servingCellConfigCommon ra_ResponseWindow=0 used in RACH config, causing window to be 0 slots, so any delay >0 exceeds window.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE runs in band 78 TDD mode, selects PRACH RO Frame/Slot 19, transmits PRACH with varying preamble_offset, but repeatedly "RAR reception failed". No successful RAR, UE keeps retransmitting PRACH. Links to ue_conf: rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1":4043 matches DU RU config, but RA fails due to invalid ra_ResponseWindow.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU starts, F1AP succeeds, DU starts RU, UE transmits PRACH repeatedly, but DU detects preamble but cannot schedule RAR due to "exceeded RA window" with ra_ResponseWindow=0, causing UE RAR failures and no connection. Misconfigured_param ra_ResponseWindow=0 invalid per 3GPP TS 38.331, as RA response window must be at least sl1 (1 slot). Hypothesis: ra_ResponseWindow=0 causes RA window to be 0 slots, so even minimal processing delay exceeds window, preventing RAR scheduling in nr_schedule_RA() or similar, leading to UE retransmissions but no progress. Correlates with spec requirement for positive window to allow RAR transmission.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].ra_ResponseWindow to 4 (sl4). Debug: Check OAI RA scheduling code for window validation; run with valid window to confirm RAR success. Tools: Use wireshark on F1AP for RAR messages. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {...}, "du_conf": {... "servingCellConfigCommon": [{"ra_ResponseWindow": 4, ...}]}, "ue_conf": {...}}.

Limitations: Logs truncated, no full RA success shown, GTPU issues may compound but RA failure is primary.
