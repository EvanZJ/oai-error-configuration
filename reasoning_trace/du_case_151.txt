Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with monolithic NFAPI mode. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads, SCTP/F1AP/NGAP setup), DU starts rfsim server, UE connects to rfsim server, F1AP connection between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, UE performs PRACH/RACH, RRC connection, PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing errors (libconfig), invalid MACRLC parameters violating OAI requirements (e.g., num_cc=0 invalid, must be >=1), bind failures on network interfaces, or AMF association failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf/du_conf) has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"/"gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs with gNB_ID=0xe00, tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list (mcc=1,mnc=1), nr_cellid=1, SCTP/F1AP ports (local_s_address=127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3, remote_s_address=127.0.0.3/127.0.0.5), amf_ip_address=192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES (GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43), SCTP (SCTP_INSTREAMS=2, SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=2), MACRLCs with num_cc=0 invalid (must be >=1), L1s with num_cc=1, servingCellConfigCommon with physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_frequencyBand=78, dl_carrierBandwidth=106, ul_carrierBandwidth=106, pMax=20, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, rsrp_ThresholdSSB=19, ssb_periodicityServingCell=2, ssPBCH_BlockPower=-25, etc. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, uicc0 (imsi=001010000000101), rfsimulator (serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043). Initial mismatch: MACRLCs[0].num_cc=0 violates OAI minimum 1 for component carriers, likely causing MACRLC initialization failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1), registers gNB[0] with gNB_CU_id=3584, checks AMF registration state. SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (errno 99: Cannot assign requested address), GTPU bind fails on 192.168.8.43:2152 (Cannot assign requested address), falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 for GTPU, creates gtpu instance id=97. F1AP starts at CU, creates SCTP socket for 127.0.0.5:10, initializes GTPU for 127.0.0.5:2152, accepts CU-UP ID 3584. Receives F1 Setup Request from DU 3584 (gNB-Eurecom-DU), sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU, creates UE context CU UE ID 1 DU UE ID 24257 (rnti: 5ec1, random ue id a49c27856000000), activates SRB 1, generates RRCSetup, processes NR_RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. But then "No AMF is associated to the gNB" - indicates NGAP/SCTP to AMF failed. Anomalies: SCTP bind failures (interface issue), but main issue is AMF association failure despite F1AP success.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, waits for gNB L1 instances, configures RU (librfsimulator loaded), sets RU mask, initializes RU threads, configures ru_id 0, waits for sync, ALL RUs READY, initializes gNBs, sends sync to threads. RU rf device ready, generates void samples, command line params for UE, client connects, sends time. NR_MAC Frame.Slot progresses, initiates RA procedure (preamble 45, energy 56.4 dB), RA-RNTI 010b, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, Msg3 scheduled, RA Contention Resolution timer started, adds UE MAC Context RNTI 5ec1, RA-Msg3 received, activates SRB 1, generates msg4, RA-Msg4 ack received, CBRA succeeded. UE stats show in-sync, RSRP -44, BLER decreasing, data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing). No crash or errors; DU fully operational, rfsim server running, UE connected and exchanging data.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, sets band 78 TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz, Harq round stats for Downlink (progressing from 8 to 11 rounds), no errors. Indicates successful connection to rfsim server, data exchange ongoing.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU initializes but SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (interface issue), falls back to loopback for GTPU/F1AP, successfully establishes F1AP with DU (F1 Setup Request/Response), UE connects via rfsim, RA succeeds, RRC connected, but "No AMF is associated" - NGAP/SCTP to AMF failed. DU fully operational, rfsim server running, UE connected and exchanging data (no issues). The misconfigured MACRLCs[0].num_cc=0 in du_conf is invalid per OAI requirements (must be >=1 for component carriers), causing MACRLC initialization failure, preventing proper F1AP setup or AMF association. F1AP succeeds because L1s has num_cc=1, but MACRLC with num_cc=0 disrupts coordination. Hypothesis: Invalid num_cc=0 violates OAI requirements, leads to MACRLC failure, CU cannot properly coordinate with DU for AMF association, but DU/UE proceed via L1/F1AP/rfsim. Guided by misconfigured_param, num_cc=0 is clearly invalid.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix MACRLCs[0].num_cc to valid value >=1 (e.g., 1, matching L1s). Debug: Check MACRLC logs, validate num_cc against OAI requirements. Tools: Use OAI config validation tools. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {... "MACRLCs": [{"num_cc": 1, ...}] ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}. This sets num_cc to 1 (valid), enabling proper MACRLC initialization.
