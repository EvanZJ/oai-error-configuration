Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA (Standalone) mode setup using rfsim (radio frequency simulator) for testing, as evidenced by logs showing --rfsim options, rfsimulator server/client modes, and frequencies like 3619200000 Hz. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1AP (CU-DU) and NGAP (CU-AMF) setup, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC configuration, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include config mismatches in SIB1 (System Information Block 1) encoding, assertions in MAC scheduler code, connection failures due to component crashes, or invalid TDD (Time Division Duplex) configurations. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (from du_conf) includes sib1_tda: 0 (invalid, causes overlap), pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP: 2, do_CSIRS: 1, maxMIMO_layers: 2, servingCellConfigCommon with dl_subcarrierSpacing: 1, ul_subcarrierSpacing: 1, dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity: 6, nrofDownlinkSlots: 7, nrofUplinkSlots: 2 (TDD pattern), prach_ConfigurationIndex: 98, ssb_periodicityServingCell: 2. ue_conf includes rfsimulator serveraddr: "127.0.0.1", serverport: "4043". Initial mismatch: sib1_tda=0 in du_conf.gNBs[0] directly matches misconfigured_param, likely causing DU assertion.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads for NGAP, GTPU, F1AP, etc. GTPU bind fails on 192.168.8.43:2152 ("Cannot assign requested address"), but switches to local 127.0.0.5:2152. NGAP registers gNB[0] with AMF. F1AP starts, receives DU F1 Setup Request from gNB_DU 3584, responds with F1 Setup Response. Then SCTP shutdown event occurs, removing endpoint and releasing DU. No AMF association success, CU waits indefinitely. Anomalies: GTPU bind failure (network config issue?), SCTP shutdown (likely due to DU crash). Cross-reference with network_config: cu_conf.gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4: "192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF: "192.168.8.43" (mismatch? 192.168.8.43 vs 192.168.70.132), but bind failure on 192.168.8.43 suggests IP not available.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes PHY, sets RF config for N_RB 106, NB_RX/TX 4, freq 3619200000 Hz. Loads rfsimulator as server, waits for clients. Creates threads, initializes RU, loads libraries (librfsimulator.so, libdfts.so, libldpc.so). Then asserts: "Assertion ((tda_info.startSymbolIndex + tda_info.nrOfSymbols) < 14) failed!" in schedule_nr_sib1() at gNB_scheduler_bch.c:591, with message "SIB1 TDA 0 would cause overlap with CSI-RS. Please select a different SIB1 TDA." Exits execution. Break down: Init succeeds until SIB1 scheduling, crash point is invalid sib1_tda=0 causing symbol overlap in TDD slot. Link to network_config: du_conf.gNBs[0].sib1_tda: 0 (matches misconfigured_param), do_CSIRS: 1 (enables CSI-RS, causing overlap with SIB1 at TDA 0).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY for 8 cards (simulating antennas?), sets freq 3619200000 Hz, loads rfsimulator as client. Tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail with errno(111) (Connection refused). No connection attempts succeed. Link to network_config: ue_conf.rfsimulator.serveraddr: "127.0.0.1", serverport: "4043" (matches attempts).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timeline: CU starts, DU starts and initializes, UE starts and tries connects. DU crashes on SIB1 scheduling assertion, causing SCTP shutdown in CU (DU disconnect). UE connect fails because rfsim server (DU) is down. Root cause: misconfigured_param "gNBs[0].sib1_tda=0" invalid; in TDD, SIB1 Time Domain Allocation (TDA) must avoid overlap with CSI-RS symbols. With do_CSIRS=1 enabled, TDA=0 (starting at symbol 0) overlaps CSI-RS (typically in later symbols), violating assertion ((start + nrOfSymbols) < 14). Guided by misconfigured_param, this is a known issue in OAI NR MAC scheduler (schedule_nr_sib1 function checks for overlap). No need for tools; based on 3GPP TS 38.213 (SIB1 scheduling) and OAI code patterns (assertions on invalid TDD configs).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change sib1_tda to valid value (e.g., 1 or 2) to avoid CSI-RS overlap; ensure TDA symbols fit within slot without conflict. Debug: Check TDD pattern (dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity, nrofDownlinkSlots) and CSI-RS config. Tools: If needed, grep OAI code for sib1_tda validation or 3GPP TS 38.213 for TDD symbol allocation. Output corrected gnb.conf (du_conf.gNBs[0]) snippet: {"sib1_tda": 1} // Changed from 0 to 1 to avoid overlap with CSI-RS in TDD slot; TDA=0 starts at symbol 0, but CSI-RS may occupy symbols 12-13, causing assertion failure.
