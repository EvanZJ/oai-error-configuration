Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in CU CMDLINE and UE logs showing rfsimulator server connection attempts. The expected flow is: CU initializes with config loading, starts NGAP for AMF association, DU initializes and connects to CU via F1AP, UE connects to rfsim server for PHY simulation, then proceeds to PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session. Potential issues include config mismatches causing AMF association failures, GTPU bind errors on non-local IPs, but F1AP/DU-UE working. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs with gNB_ID=0xe00, plmn_list with mcc=1, mnc=1, snssaiList sst=1, local_s_address=127.0.0.5, SCTP with SCTP_INSTREAMS=2, amf_ip_address={} (empty object, matching misconfigured_param), NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43, security with ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"], integrity_algorithms=["nia2","nia0"], log_config populated with levels. du_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with plmn_list=[{"mcc":1,"mnc":1,"mnc_length":2,"snssaiList":[{"sst":1,"sd":"0x010203"}]}] etc., rfsimulator serveraddr="server". ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: cu_conf gNBs.amf_ip_address={} is empty, unlike expected populated object, which will cause NGAP AMF association failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC/PDCP/SDAP, creates threads TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1, TASK_GTPV1_U. Registers gNB with NGAP, configures GTPU SA mode, binds GTPU to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails "bind: Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99, IP not local), can't create GTP-U instance. F1AP starts, binds to 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response, accepts UE context, processes RRCSetupComplete, UE connected. But NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: GTPU bind failure on non-local IP, but F1AP succeeds, UE connects but no AMF association.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, waits for L1/RU, configures RU with rfsim, loads libraries, initializes random, sets up buffers, syncs threads. RU RF started, rfsim client connects, sends time. RA procedure initiates, Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 succeed, UE context added, scheduling activated. Data exchange continues with UE in-sync, RSRP -44, BLER low, MCS 9. No crashes, F1AP connection stable.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, sets band 78 TDD, connects to rfsim server, performs RA, receives Msg2, sends Msg3, receives Msg4 Ack, connects successfully. Data exchange with DL/UL stats, HARQ rounds increasing, BLER decreasing. No connection failures, stable link.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU initializes but GTPU bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (not local IP), can't create GTP-U instance, but F1AP works on 127.0.0.5, DU connects, UE connects via rfsim, RA succeeds, RRC connected. But NGAP "No AMF is associated" because amf_ip_address={} empty, no AMF IP configured, so NGAP can't initiate association. Timeline: CU starts, F1AP/DU connect, UE connects, but AMF association fails due to empty amf_ip_address={}. Hypothesis: Empty gNBs.amf_ip_address={} prevents NGAP from configuring AMF IP, causing association failure, while GTPU bind failure is separate (IP not local, but NETWORK_INTERFACES has GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=192.168.8.43, mismatch with local interfaces). Guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.amf_ip_address={}", this is a known invalid config causing AMF association failure (amf_ip_address must have ipv4 field). GTPU issue may be related but not root cause for AMF.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix by populating gNBs.amf_ip_address in cu_conf with valid IPv4, e.g., {"ipv4":"192.168.70.132"}. For GTPU bind, ensure IP is local or adjust NETWORK_INTERFACES. Debug: Check NGAP logs for AMF connection attempts, verify AMF IP reachability. Tools: Use ping to test AMF IP, grep OAI code for amf_ip_address usage. Corrected configs: cu_conf gNBs.amf_ip_address={"ipv4":"192.168.70.132"}; du_conf unchanged; ue_conf unchanged.

Limitations: CU logs show GTPU bind failure but F1AP success, UE/DU logs truncated but show success; network_config lacks full interface details, assumes 192.168.8.43 not local. Base on OAI NGAP requires amf_ip_address for association, 3GPP TS 38.413 for NG setup.
