Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options implied in the logs (e.g., UE logs show "Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side" and attempts to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043). The expected flow is: CU initializes with GTPU/NGAP setup, DU initializes with F1AP connection to CU, F1AP setup completes, radio activates, UE connects to rfsim server for PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid IP addresses causing socket bind errors), SCTP connection failures preventing F1AP/NGAP, or rfsim server not starting due to DU not activating. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf.gNBs) has gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-CU", tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list with mcc=1/mnc=1/mnc_length=2/sst=1, nr_cellid=123456789, tr_s_preference="f1", local_s_if_name="lo", local_s_address=12345 (invalid integer instead of IP string), remote_s_address="127.0.0.3", local_s_portc=501, local_s_portd=2152, remote_s_portc=500, remote_s_portd=2152, SCTP_INSTREAMS/OUTSTREAMS=2, amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU="192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: local_s_address=12345 is invalid (should be IPv4 string like "127.0.0.5" based on DU's remote_n_address), causing bind failures in logs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, registers gNB[0] with NGAP (id 3584), sets up threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU/CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode, tries to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails with "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99, likely invalid address), SCTP bindx also fails, GTPU instance creation fails (-1), E1AP CUUP N3 UDP listener fails, SCTP socket open fails. Falls back to F1AP socket creation for 127.0.0.1:10 (len 10), GTPU binds to 127.0.0.1:2152 successfully (id 97), RRC enters main loop, accepts CU-UP ID 3584 name "gNB-Eurecom-CU" (assoc_id -1). No AMF association shown, no NGAP setup. Anomalies: Early GTPU bind failure on 192.168.8.43, but fallback to 127.0.0.1 works for F1AP. Cross-reference: 192.168.8.43 is GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU, but local_s_address=12345 invalidates it.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU loads config, sets parallel_conf=2/worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst/nb_nr_L1_inst/nb_ru=1, configures for RAU/RRU, DL/UL freq 3619200000 band 48, F1 interfaces for MACRLC. Initializes northbound L1, PHY structures, RRC/SDAP, threads for SCTP/GNB_APP/GTPV1_U/DU_F1. F1AP starts at DU, IPaddr 127.0.0.3 connect to CU 127.0.0.5, GTPU binds to 127.0.0.3:2152 (id 98), SCTP connect fails "Connection refused" repeatedly, F1AP retries association. PHY initializes gNB 0, registers IF modules, sets RU GPIO/clock, thread pools, waits for F1 Setup Response before radio activation. No crash, but stuck retrying F1AP. Anomalies: Repeated SCTP failures, no F1 setup. Cross-reference: DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5, but CU's local_s_address invalid prevents proper binding.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars for gNB TXant1/RXant1, PRS config not found, symbol rotation for 3619200000 Hz, sets N_TA_offset, configures HW cards 0-7 for TDD duplex, tx/rx freq 3619200000, gains. Initializes threads for UEthread/L1_UE_stats/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE. Runs as rfsim client, loads RFSIMULATOR device, tries connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail errno(111) "Connection refused". UICC sim with IMSI=001010000000101. Anomalies: Persistent connect failures. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches attempts, but server not running because DU not activated.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU fails GTPU bind on 192.168.8.43 due to invalid local_s_address=12345 (integer not IP string), cascades to E1AP listener failure, SCTP socket failure, preventing proper F1AP server setup. DU retries SCTP to 127.0.0.5 but CU's invalid address disrupts network interfaces, causing "Connection refused". UE can't connect to rfsim server because DU waits for F1 setup, radio not activated. Timeline: CU init fails early on bind, DU starts but can't connect, UE loops on connect. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "gNBs.local_s_address=12345" invalidates IP address parsing in libconfig/OAI code, causing bind failure (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address" for invalid addr). This blocks CU-DU F1AP, preventing DU radio activation and rfsim server start, thus UE fails. Guided by misconfigured_param, root cause is invalid local_s_address type (int vs string), per OAI param validation (expects IPv4 string). No tools needed, as logs/code patterns confirm (e.g., similar to prior cases with invalid params causing bind/socket errors).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change local_s_address from 12345 to valid IPv4 string, e.g., "127.0.0.5" (matching DU's remote_n_address for F1AP). Debug: Check OAI config_userapi.c for IP validation, use strace for bind calls, verify interfaces with ifconfig. Tools: If spec details needed, search "3GPP TS 23.501 IP address formats" or "OAI gNB local_s_address parameter". Corrected config snippets: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"local_s_address": "127.0.0.5" /* Changed from invalid int 12345 to valid IP string for F1AP binding */}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}}.
