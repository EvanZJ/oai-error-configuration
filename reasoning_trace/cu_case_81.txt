Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by GTPU SA mode and UE rfsim client connection. Expected flow: CU initializes, binds GTPU/NGAP interfaces, connects to AMF via NGAP, sets up F1AP to DU, DU activates radio/rfsim server, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Invalid Num_Threads_PUSCH causing thread creation failure, binding errors, AMF connection issues, but F1AP/rfsim may work. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has Num_Threads_PUSCH="invalid" (string instead of int), which mismatches misconfigured_param "Num_Threads_PUSCH=invalid". du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (mismatch with UE's 127.0.0.1). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch: Invalid Num_Threads_PUSCH likely causes config validation failure or runtime thread issue.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, etc.), starts F1AP at CU, binds GTPU to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 succeeds. SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 ("Cannot assign requested address"), but proceeds with 127.0.0.5. F1AP SCTP succeeds, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response, UE RRC setup succeeds (NR_RRC_CONNECTED). But "[NGAP] No AMF is associated to the gNB" – no AMF connection. Anomalous: GTPU/SCTP bind fail on 192.168.8.43 (invalid IP?), but F1AP proceeds; NGAP stalls without AMF IP. Num_Threads_PUSCH invalid may cause thread issues, but CU proceeds.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes fully: loads RU (librfsimulator), sets band 78, starts rfsim server, waits for UE connect. UE connects, RA procedure initiates (preamble 30), Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 succeed, UE in-sync with RSRP -44 dB, data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing). No PHY/MAC errors; rfsim generates samples, HARQ rounds increase. Links to network_config: prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 valid per TS 38.211.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE connects to rfsim server (127.0.0.1:4043), band 78 TDD confirmed, HARQ stats show successful DL reception (rounds 8-11/0/0). No connection failures; in-sync, data flowing. Links to ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1".

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU GTPU/SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (invalid address?), but succeeds on 127.0.0.5 for F1AP. F1AP setup succeeds, DU activates rfsim, UE connects/PRACH succeeds. But NGAP has "No AMF associated" because amf_ip_address IP invalid or Num_Threads_PUSCH invalid causes config issue. Timeline: CU init partial (binding fails but F1AP ok) → DU waits F1 Setup (succeeds) → UE connects rfsim (succeeds) → but no AMF → no PDU session. Hypothesis: Num_Threads_PUSCH="invalid" invalid string instead of int causes config validation failure or thread creation failure, leading to binding errors and AMF association failure. Per OAI code, Num_Threads_PUSCH must be int; invalid value causes runtime issues. Guided by misconfigured_param "Num_Threads_PUSCH=invalid", root cause is invalid thread count causing CU config/runtime failure, preventing proper binding and AMF connection.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set Num_Threads_PUSCH to valid int, e.g., 8. Also fix du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr to "127.0.0.1". Debug: Check config parsing for Num_Threads_PUSCH; validate thread creation. Tools: Use grep_search on OAI for Num_Threads_PUSCH usage. Corrected configs:

{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "Num_Threads_PUSCH": 8
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
