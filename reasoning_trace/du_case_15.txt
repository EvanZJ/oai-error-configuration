Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: The scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) in Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulator (rfsim), as indicated by the command-line options --rfsim --sa in the logs. The expected flow is component initialization (CU, DU, UE), followed by F1/NGAP setup between CU and DU, AMF connection, UE attachment via PRACH, RRC connection establishment, and PDU session setup. Potential issues include configuration mismatches in SCTP parameters, connection failures due to invalid streams, and association failures. Parsing the network_config JSON: gnb_conf (DU config) includes SCTP parameters with SCTP_INSTREAMS=0, SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=2, and other parameters like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98. ue_conf includes rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatches noted: The config sets SCTP_INSTREAMS=0, which is invalid for SCTP associations requiring at least 1 stream.

Analyzing CU Logs: The CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPU. It sets gNB_CU_id=3584, registers with NGAP, starts F1AP with SCTP listener on 127.0.0.5. GTPU bind fails, but alternative bind succeeds. F1AP receives F1 Setup Request from DU, accepts it, sends response. UE RRC setup succeeds, but NGAP shows "No AMF is associated to the gNB", possibly due to AMF unavailability. No major SCTP errors for F1AP.

Analyzing DU Logs: The DU initializes, configures RU, starts RF simulator, initiates RA procedure, sends F1 Setup Request to CU, receives response. UE connects successfully, RA completes, data exchange occurs (TX/RX bytes increasing). No explicit SCTP errors, but the config SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 may cause issues if used.

Analyzing UE Logs: The UE initializes, connects to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, performs RA, connects successfully. Continuous data exchange with increasing TX/RX bytes, BLER low, MCS stable at 9.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The system appears functional, but the misconfigured SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 is invalid. In OAI F1AP, the DU sends SCTP_NEW_ASSOCIATION_REQ with in_streams from config (potentially 0), causing association failure if 0 is used. Guided by the misconfigured parameter, the root cause is SCTP_INSTREAMS=0 leading to invalid SCTP association request, failing F1AP connection. Using external knowledge from RFC 4960, SCTP requires at least 1 stream; OAI code may use config for streams, causing failure.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update SCTP_INSTREAMS to 2 for valid SCTP associations. Debug by checking if code uses config for streams, verify SCTP logs. Tools: Review OAI F1AP code for stream usage, RFC 4960 for SCTP requirements. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"SCTP": {"SCTP_INSTREAMS": 2}}]}} â€“ this changes SCTP_INSTREAMS from 0 to 2, ensuring valid SCTP association.

Limitations: Logs show success, possibly due to hardcoded streams in code ignoring config; truncated logs; incomplete JSON may omit details.
