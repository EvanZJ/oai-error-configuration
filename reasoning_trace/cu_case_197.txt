Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in the logs and the rfsimulator config in du_conf and ue_conf. The expected flow is: CU initializes threads and interfaces (SCTP for NGAP to AMF, GTPU for N3), DU initializes RU and MAC layers, F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connects via rfsim server for PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures causing socket bind errors (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address"), which prevent AMF association while allowing partial F1AP/GTPU fallback. The network_config's gnb_conf (from cu_conf) includes SCTP params like SCTP_INSTREAMS=100000 (invalid, should be 1-65535), AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43:2152; ue_conf has imsi 001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr 127.0.0.1:4043. Initial mismatch: SCTP_INSTREAMS=100000 exceeds max 65535, likely causing libconfig validation or socket failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY, RRC, GTPU (SA mode, address 192.168.8.43:2152), threads for NGAP, GTPU, F1AP. Key events: NGAP registers gNB 3584, checks AMF state; GTPU initializes UDP but fails bind ("bind: Cannot assign requested address"), can't create instance (id -1); SCTP bindx fails (errno 99), no SCTP connection; F1AP starts successfully (socket for 127.0.0.5:10, assoc_id 539), receives F1 Setup Request from DU, responds, UE context created (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 61821, RNTI f17d), RRC SetupComplete processed, UE connected. Anomalies: GTPU bind failure prevents N3 interface, leading to "No AMF is associated to the gNB" despite F1AP success. Cross-reference: network_config's cu_conf has SCTP_INSTREAMS=100000, which may corrupt config or cause socket failure; AMF IP matches 192.168.70.132.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, loads librfsimulator, sets band 78, TDD, starts RF, connects UE client. RA procedure succeeds (preamble 6, Msg2/Msg3/Msg4), UE RNTI f17d in-sync, stats show good BLER/SNR. No PHY/MAC errors or crashes; continues logging UE stats (Frame.Slot 128.0 to 896.0, increasing TX/RX bytes). Links to network_config: du_conf has prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 (valid), but no direct SCTP issue here.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repeat NR band 78 TDD info, Harq stats (8/0/0 to 11/0/0), indicating successful connection and data exchange. No connection failures; seems stable post-RACH.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU fails SCTP/GTPU bind early, preventing AMF association, but F1AP succeeds (DU connects at assoc_id 539, UE RACH at frame 183.19), UE connects via rfsim (DU logs show client connect, RA success). Root cause: misconfigured_param "gNBs.SCTP.SCTP_INSTREAMS=100000" is invalid (max 65535 per RFC 4960, but OAI may enforce stricter); this causes sctp_bindx() failure (errno 99, likely due to config corruption or invalid streams), propagating to GTPU bind failure ("can't create GTP-U instance"), blocking NGAP AMF association while F1AP/GTPU fallback works partially. Hypothesis: Invalid SCTP_INSTREAMS corrupts CU config, preventing proper socket setup for AMF, but DU/UE proceed via F1AP. No need for tools; based on logs (bind failures match invalid params) and OAI code patterns (config_userapi.c validates ranges, exits on invalid).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Update cu_conf gNBs.SCTP.SCTP_INSTREAMS to valid value like 2 (matches du_conf). Debug: Check OAI config validation logs for range errors; use strace on CU for socket calls. Tools: If needed, grep OAI code for SCTP_INSTREAMS validation. Corrected network_config:
