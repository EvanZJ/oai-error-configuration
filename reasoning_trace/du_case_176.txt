Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, as indicated by --rfsim --sa options in DU logs and UE connecting to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043. Expected flow: CU initializes GTPU/NGAP/F1AP, DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC with timing config, starts rfsim server, UE connects for PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Timing config mismatches in DU (e.g., invalid min_rxtxtime causing RA Msg3 scheduling assertions), asserts in nr_ue_pusch_scheduler(), RA failures preventing connection. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU on 127.0.0.5:2152 (successful after initial fail). du_conf has gNB-Eurecom-DU with min_rxtxtime=0 (misconfigured), other params like pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043, imsi=001010000000101. Initial mismatch: min_rxtxtime=0 in du_conf, but must be >=3 for RA timing.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads for NGAP/F1AP/GTPU, registers gNB[0], F1AP starts CU side, GTPU succeeds on 127.0.0.5:2152. Key events: Receives F1 Setup Request from DU, accepts DU, sends F1 Setup Response. Anomalies: GTPU bind fails initially (errno 99), but retries succeed; CU proceeds to F1AP setup. No direct link to misconfigured param, but CU relies on DU for RA timing.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU/RF, starts rfsim server, UE connects, RA procedure initiates (preamble 40, energy 54.0 dB), generates RA-Msg2 DCI, schedules Msg3, contention resolution timer, receives Msg3 retransmissions, RA fails ("Random Access 0 failed at state WAIT_Msg3"). Break down: RU ready, RF started, UE syncs, RA starts but fails on Msg3 scheduling due to timing issue. Links to network_config: min_rxtxtime=0 invalid for RA Msg3 slot offset (must >=3 per OAI nr_ue_pusch_scheduler()).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes HW for TDD at 3619200000 Hz, connects to 127.0.0.1:4043, syncs successfully (PCI 0, carrier offset 15 Hz), decodes SIB1, initiates RA (PRACH at 183.19), receives RAR with RAPID 40, but assertion: "Assertion ((k2 + delta) > ((3))) failed!" in nr_ue_pusch_scheduler(), "Slot offset (0) for Msg3 needs to be higher than DURATION_RX_TO_TX (3). Please set min_rxtxtime at least to 3 in gNB config file or gNBs.[0].min_rxtxtime=3 via command line.", exiting UE. Links to network_config: rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043 matches connection; min_rxtxtime=0 causes k2+delta <=3, violating RA timing.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines: CU F1AP setup, DU RU init/RF start, UE connects/syncs, RA starts, RAR sent, UE asserts on Msg3 scheduling. Correlation: DU starts rfsim, UE connects but RA fails due to timing assert; CU waits for connection. Misconfigured param "gNBs[0].min_rxtxtime=0" causes slot offset 0 <= DURATION_RX_TO_TX 3, violating RA Msg3 scheduling in nr_ue_pusch_scheduler(); OAI enforces min_rxtxtime >=3 for UL TX timing after DL RX.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set min_rxtxtime to 6 in du_conf gNBs[0], ensuring >=3 for RA Msg3 slot offset. This allows proper UL TX timing, RA succeeds, UE connects. Debug: Check OAI nr_ue_pusch_scheduler() for k2/delta calculations; verify TS 38.213 RA timing. Further: Test with corrected config, monitor RA success. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... (unchanged)}, "du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"min_rxtxtime": 6, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {... (unchanged)}}. This fixes invalid min_rxtxtime causing RA Msg3 timing assert and UE crash.
