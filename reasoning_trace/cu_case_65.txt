Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulation (rfsim), utilizing a CU-DU split architecture where CU and DU run as separate processes (nr-softmodem instances), and UE simulated via rfsim client connecting to the DU's rfsimulator server. Expected flow: CU initializes, loads configuration (including NG_AMF IP for NGAP), starts GTPU (N3), NGAP, and F1AP servers; DU initializes, establishes F1AP SCTP connection to CU, waits for F1 Setup Response, then activates radio and starts rfsimulator server; UE initializes, connects to rfsimulator server for PHY simulation, performs PRACH/RRC/NGAP procedures for PDU session setup. Potential issues: Config parameter validation failures (e.g., empty NG_AMF IP causing NGAP bind failures or AMF association failures), SCTP connection refusals (errno 111, "Connection refused"), GTPU/NGAP bind failures, F1AP setup stalls, rfsim server not starting (preventing UE connect). Network_config parsed: cu_conf includes gNBs with NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="" (empty; invalid, should be valid IPv4 like "192.168.70.132"), amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.70.132" (valid). du_conf includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="server" (invalid). ue_conf includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Key mismatches: GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="" invalid; du_conf "server" vs. ue_conf "127.0.0.1". Guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=", hypothesize empty NG_AMF IP causes NGAP socket bind failure, preventing AMF association and F1AP setup.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in monolithic mode ("nfapi (0) running mode: MONOLITHIC"), initializes OPT, HW, PHY, GNB_APP, allocates RRC/PDCP, but logs truncate at "[PDCP] pdcp init,usegtp ". No NGAP init, AMF connection, F1AP start, or GTPU setup shown. Anomalies: Incomplete logs (ends abruptly), no key events like AMF association or F1AP binding. Cross-reference: cu_conf NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="" directly matches misconfigured_param, likely causes NGAP socket bind failure (per OAI ngap_gNB.c expecting valid IP for bind), halting NGAP init and preventing F1AP setup.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU loads config successfully, initializes RUs, PHY, threads, starts F1AP at DU, attempts SCTP connect to CU (127.0.0.5:500), but "Connect failed: Connection refused", retries indefinitely. GTPU initializes on 127.0.0.3:2152. "[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" stalls DU. No radio activation or rfsim server start. Cross-reference: du_conf MACRLCs remote_n_address="127.0.0.5" valid, but CU not running F1AP server means no listener.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY, HW, threads, runs as rfsim client, attempts connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, fails with errno(111) "Connection refused". No RRC/PRACH attempts. Cross-reference: ue_conf rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches attempts, but server not started by DU.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU fails NGAP init due to empty NG_AMF IP (bind failure), exits or stalls without starting F1AP server; DU starts, attempts F1AP SCTP connect but refused (no CU server), retries indefinitely, doesn't activate radio/rfsim; UE connect fails (no DU server). No F1AP/NGAP setup, no UE connection. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=" (empty string) invalid (not a valid IPv4 address), causes NGAP socket bind failure in CU (per OAI code expecting valid IP for NGAP bind), aborting NGAP init and preventing F1AP setup (CU may require NGAP success for F1AP). CU not running F1AP server means DU connect failures and stall. DU not activating radio prevents rfsim server start, causing UE connect refusals. External knowledge: OAI uses GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF for NGAP socket bind; empty IP triggers bind failure (errno 99, "Cannot assign requested address"). 3GPP TS 38.413 requires valid AMF IP for NGAP; invalid IP prevents association. Root cause: empty NG_AMF IP causes NGAP bind failure, preventing AMF association and F1AP setup despite DU/UE readiness.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Update cu_conf gNBs NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.70.132" (valid NG_AMF IP). Also correct du_conf rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Debug: Check CU NGAP bind logs; verify AMF IP reachability. Re-run; expect NGAP association, F1AP setup, AMF association, PDU session. If persists, check OAI AMF sim process. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"NETWORK_INTERFACES": {"GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.70.132"}}}, {"du_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"}}, {"ue_conf": {}}. Limitations: Truncated CU logs (ends at PDCP init); no timestamps; assumes empty IP causes bind failure (per similar cases like cu_case_64).
