Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, as indicated by the logs showing --rfsim options and librfsimulator.so loading. The expected flow involves component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connection via PRACH/RRC, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include config mismatches in servingCellConfigCommon parameters (e.g., invalid subcarrier spacing causing bandwidth index calculations to fail), asserts in UE code during SIB1 parsing or bandwidth determination, or connection failures due to invalid PRACH configs. Parsing network_config: cu_conf includes AMF IP (192.168.70.132), GTPU address (192.168.8.43), and F1AP ports; du_conf has servingCellConfigCommon with msg1_SubcarrierSpacing: 0 (potentially invalid if expected >0 for band 78), band 78, SCS 1, PRACH index 98, and other params; ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch noted: msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=0 may violate OAI expectations for PRACH SCS in band 78, potentially causing UE bandwidth index calculation to result in -1 and assertion failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization proceeds normally with monolithic mode, thread creation for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPV1_U/TASK_CU_F1, and F1AP start. Key events include F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ for DU connection (127.0.0.5), GTPU configuration with SA mode and address 192.168.8.43:2152 (but bind fails due to "Cannot assign requested address"), F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), F1 Setup Response, and DU uses RRC version 17.3.0. Anomalies include SCTP bind failure ("Cannot assign requested address"), GTPU bind failure preventing CUUP N3 UDP listener creation, and no further UE connection logs (truncated). Cross-reference with network_config: AMF IP matches cu_conf, but binding issues suggest network config mismatch (e.g., address not available), not directly related to msg1_SubcarrierSpacing but indicating CU-AMF communication failure.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization includes RU setup with rfsim (librfsimulator.so loaded, server running), antenna ports, TDD config, and RF started. Key events: RU configured with band 78, SCS 1, RF started, "Lost socket" warning, and periodic frame/slot logs without RA or UE activity. No RA procedure, UE connection, or data exchange noted; logs end abruptly. Link to network_config: servingCellConfigCommon params like PRACH index 98, msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=0 are loaded, but no direct errors; absence of UE activity suggests DU is waiting for UE, but UE crashes before connecting.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initialization includes HW configuration for 4 TX/RX channels, rfsimulator client connection attempts (multiple failures with errno 111, then success), SSB sync detection, cell detection with PCI 0, SIB1 decoding, and band 78 TDD confirmation. Anomalies include repeated connection failures, "Gap in writing to USRP" warning, and critical assertion failure: "Assertion (0) failed! In get_supported_bw_mhz() ... Invalid band index for FR1 -1" causing exit. Link to network_config: ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" matches DU rfsim, but msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=0 in du_conf causes UE to parse invalid SCS, leading to bw_index=-1 in bandwidth calculation and assertion.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU initializes and sets up F1 with DU, DU starts RU/rfsim server, UE attempts connection (multiple failures, then success), achieves sync and decodes SIB1, but asserts in get_supported_bw_mhz with bw_index=-1. CU has network binding issues preventing AMF association, but UE crash occurs before RRC connection. Hypothesis: msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=0 is invalid per OAI implementation for band 78 (where SCS=30 kHz), as TS 38.331 allows 0 (kHz15), but OAI may expect matching SCS or positive values, causing UE bandwidth index calculation to yield -1 and assertion in get_supported_bw_mhz. Guided by misconfigured_param "msg1_SubcarrierSpacing=0", root cause is invalid PRACH SCS value violating OAI bandwidth calculation logic, leading to UE crash during SIB1 processing.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update msg1_SubcarrierSpacing to a valid value like 1 (kHz30) to match band 78 SCS. Debug steps: Check OAI UE code for msg1_SubcarrierSpacing usage in bandwidth index calculation; verify TS 38.331 compliance for band 78 PRACH SCS; run with corrected config to ensure UE sync and connection. Tools: Use ASN.1 decoder on SIB1 messages; monitor UE logs for assertion sources. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"msg1_SubcarrierSpacing": 1}]}]}} (assuming 1 for 30 kHz SCS; adjust based on band requirements). Limitations: Logs truncated, no CU/UE post-crash logs; DU logs lack UE activity; assertion message mismatch with code suggests logging issue.
