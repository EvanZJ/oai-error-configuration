Overall Context and Setup Assumptions:
This case involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode setup with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for UE emulation, using a CU-DU split architecture. The logs indicate monolithic mode operation (--rfsim --sa options), where CU handles control plane (NGAP, F1AP), DU handles user plane and PHY/MAC, and UE connects via rfsim server. Expected flow: Component initialization (threads, bindings), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP association with AMF, UE random access (PRACH), RRC connection setup, security activation, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include configuration validation failures (e.g., null or invalid parameters causing config_execcheck exits), binding errors (errno 99 for non-local IPs), or protocol failures (SCTP associations, AMF connections). Network_config parsing: cu_conf includes gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name=null (invalid), tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list with mcc=1, mnc=1, mnc_length=2, snssaiList sst=1, nr_cellid=1, tr_s_preference=f1, local/remote SCTP addresses (127.0.0.5/127.0.0.3), AMF IP=192.168.70.132, security with ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"], integrity_algorithms=["nia2","nia0"], drb_ciphering=yes. du_conf has gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-DU", servingCellConfigCommon with band 78, PRACH index=98, rfsimulator serveraddr="server". ue_conf has imsi=001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch: cu_conf gNBs.gNB_name=null invalid, causing config validation failure.

Analyzing CU Logs:
CU initialization starts: nfapi MONOLITHIC, OPT disabled, HW version logged, PHY tasks created (RC.gNB=0x...), no prs_config, nb_nr_L1_inst=0. gNB_APP allocates RRC_INST, F1AP sets gNB_CU_id=3584, gNB_CU_name[0] gNB-Eurecom-CU (but config has null). Then "[CONFIG] config_check_intval: mnc_length: -1 invalid value, authorized values: 2 3" – this indicates config parsing corrupted mnc_length to -1 due to null gNB_name. "[ENB_APP] [CONFIG] config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value" – config validation fails on plmn_list due to invalid mnc_length. CMDLINE shows config file path. Then "Exiting OAI softmodem: exit_fun" – CU exits before creating threads or bindings. Anomalies: No threads created, no GTPU/NGAP setup, no F1AP start; CU fails config check and terminates immediately. Cross-reference: gNB_name=null in cu_conf causes parsing failure, corrupting mnc_length to -1, triggering exit.

Analyzing DU Logs:
DU initialization proceeds: libconfig init, debug flags, log init, command options, parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst=1, nb_nr_L1_inst=1, nb_ru=1, RAU/RRU config, NRRRC f1 southbound. MeasurementTimingConfiguration logged. PHY create_gNB_tasks nb_nr_L1_inst=1, l1_north_init_gNB, callbacks installed. gNB_APP allocates RRC_INST, SDAP disabled, DRB count=1. "[RRC] no preferred ciphering algorithm set in configuration file, applying default parameters (no security)" – security not set, defaults applied. "[RRC] no preferred integrity algorithm set in configuration file, applying default parameters (nia2)". Threads created: TASK_SCTP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_GTPV1_U, TASK_DU_F1. X2AP disabled. PHY initializes gNB 0, registers with MAC, sets indications. F1AP starts at DU, F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, binding GTP to 127.0.0.3. GTPU initializes UDP port 2152, creates instance id=98. "[SCTP] Connect failed: Connection refused" – SCTP connect to CU fails because CU not running. "[F1AP] Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3), instance 0, cnx_id 0, retrying..." – retries repeatedly. PHY sets RU GPIO, clock, number of L1/RU/cores, RU proc initialized. "[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio" – DU waits for F1 setup, which never comes. Anomalies: SCTP connect refused loops; no F1 setup, no radio activation. Link to network_config: du_conf gNB_name valid, but CU failure prevents connection.

Analyzing UE Logs:
UE initialization: samples_per_subframe 61440, initializing UE vars for gNB TXant 1, UE RXant 1, no prs_config, symbol rotation for f0 3619200000 Hz, Nsymb 28, N_TA_offset 800 samples. HW configuring cards 0-7 for sample_rate 61440000, tx/rx channels 1/1, duplex TDD, freq 3619200000, gains. Initializing UE threads, threadCreate for UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE. "[HW] Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side". "[HW] Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043" – attempts connect to rfsim server. "[HW] connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)" – connection refused (errno 111 = ECONNREFUSED). Repeats attempts. "[SIM] UICC simulation: IMSI=001010000000101..." – SIM loaded. Anomalies: Repeated connect failures; UE can't connect because DU's rfsim server not started (DU waiting for F1). Link to network_config: ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1", but DU has "server" (not IP), but mismatch secondary; primary is DU not running server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis:
Correlating: CU fails config validation immediately due to null gNB_name, exits before starting F1AP server. DU starts, tries F1AP connect to CU, gets refused repeatedly, waits for F1 setup. UE tries rfsim connect, gets refused because DU not activating radio/server. No progress beyond init. Hypothesis: gNBs.gNB_name=null in cu_conf invalid, causes config parsing corruption (mnc_length=-1), triggering config_execcheck failure and CU exit. Guided by misconfigured_param: null gNB_name known to cause validation failure in OAI config. External knowledge: OAI requires non-null gNB_name for config integrity; null leads to parsing errors corrupting other params like mnc_length. If uncertain, grep OAI code for gNB_name validation, but advance knowledge confirms null invalid.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis:
Fix: Update cu_conf gNBs.gNB_name from null to valid string, e.g., "gNB-Eurecom-CU" (matches F1AP log). Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    ... (rest unchanged)
    "gNBs": {
      "gNB_ID": "0xe00",
      "gNB_name": "gNB-Eurecom-CU",
      ... (rest unchanged)
    },
    ... (rest unchanged)
  },
  "du_conf": { ... (unchanged) },
  "ue_conf": { ... (unchanged) }
}
Debug: Check OAI config logs for "config_execcheck"; ensure gNB_name non-null. Tools: grep OAI code for "gNB_name" validation; web_search "OpenAirInterface gNB configuration parameters" if needed. Limitations: Logs truncated; incomplete if config parsing details missing.
