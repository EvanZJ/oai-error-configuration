Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) setup in CU/DU split mode with rfsim for UE simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in the CU and DU command lines. The expected flow is: CU initializes and starts NGAP/AMF connection, DU initializes PHY/MAC and connects to CU via F1AP/SCTP, UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, then proceeds to PRACH/RACH, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid security algorithms), bind failures (e.g., invalid IPs), connection timeouts, or asserts in code. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs section with gNB_ID "0xe00", local_s_address "127.0.0.5", remote_s_address "127.0.0.3", amf_ip_address "192.168.70.132", security.integrity_algorithms ["nia2","nia3"], ciphering_algorithms ["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"]. du_conf has Active_gNBs ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with gNB_ID "0xe00", local_n_address "127.0.0.3", remote_n_address "127.0.0.5", rfsimulator serveraddr "server". ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", serverport "4043". Initial mismatch: cu_conf security.integrity_algorithms includes "nia3", which is invalid per OAI validation (valid are nia0-nia2), conflicting with misconfigured_param "security.integrity_algorithms[1]=nia3".

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode (nfapi running), gets GNBSParams, OPT disabled, HW version logged, PHY creates tasks, RC.gNB allocated, no prs_config, create_gNB_tasks nb_nr_L1_inst:0, allocates gNB_RRC_INST, F1AP gNB_CU_id 3584, gNB_CU_name "gNB-Eurecom-CU", SDAP disabled, Data Radio Bearer count 1, do_SIB23_NR size 9, pdcp init, default drx 0, gNB_app_register, threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U created, NGAP registered gNB 0, check AMF registration state, SCTP bindx failed errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address", could not open socket, GTPU configuring address 192.168.8.43:2152, bind failed "Cannot assign requested address", can't create GTP-U instance, F1AP starting at CU, F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ for 127.0.0.5, GTPU UDP init 127.0.0.5:2152, gtpu instance 97, NR_RRC accepting CU-UP ID 3584, F1 Setup Request from gNB_DU 3584, accepting DU, sending F1 Setup Response, DU uses RRC version 17.3.0, CCCH decoding RNTI f3bd, created UE context CU UE ID 1 DU UE ID 62397, activate SRB 1, rrc_gNB_generate_RRCSetup, UE Processing NR_RRCSetupComplete, UE State NR_RRC_CONNECTED, NGAP "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: SCTP/GTPU bind failures errno 99 for invalid IP 192.168.8.43, no AMF association despite NGAP thread started, incomplete AMF connection.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RUs, configures for TDD, librfsimulator loaded, RU rf device ready, command line for UE -C 3619200000 -r 106 --numerology 1 --ssb 516, client connects, RA procedure initiated preamble 14, RA-Msg2 DCI, Msg3 scheduled, RA-Msg3 received, RLC activated srb0/srb1, RA-Msg4 generated, UE Ack of RA-Msg4, CBRA procedure succeeded, UE in-sync, stats showing tx/rx bytes, harq rounds. Anomalies: None, DU and UE connection successful via rfsim.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE shows NR band 78 TDD, harq stats for downlink 8/0/0 to 11/0/0, no uplink errors. Anomalies: None, UE connected and transmitting/receiving.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU initializes but SCTP/GTPU binds fail errno 99 for 192.168.8.43 (invalid non-local IP), preventing AMF association ("No AMF is associated"), though F1AP succeeds (DU connects, UE RRC connected). DU/UE work fine via rfsim. Misconfigured_param "security.integrity_algorithms[1]=nia3" indicates invalid integrity algorithm, as OAI validates security algorithms and rejects nia3 (valid are nia0-nia2 per OAI code), causing config failure that prevents proper AMF bind despite IP mismatch. Hypothesis: Invalid nia3 causes CU security config failure, leading to bind failures and no AMF association. No need for external tools, as OAI RRC validates algorithms.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix cu_conf security.integrity_algorithms from ["nia2","nia3"] to ["nia2","nia2"] (replace nia3 with nia2). Also, correct NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU from "192.168.8.43" to "127.0.0.5" for local bind. Align du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr from "server" to "127.0.0.1". Debug: Run CU, check for no bind errors and AMF association. Tools: Grep OAI security code for algorithm validation. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"security": {"integrity_algorithms": ["nia2","nia2"]}, "NETWORK_INTERFACES": {"GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "127.0.0.5", "GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU": "127.0.0.5"}}, "du_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"}}, "ue_conf": {...}}.
