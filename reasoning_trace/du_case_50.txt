Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: The scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) mode setup with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for testing, utilizing a centralized unit (CU) and distributed unit (DU) split architecture connected via F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) for control plane and NG Application Protocol (NGAP) for core network interface. The expected flow includes component initialization (PHY, MAC, RRC layers), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE attachment via Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) and Random Access (RA) procedure, RRC connection establishment, and PDU session setup. Potential issues to look for include configuration mismatches in PUCCH power control parameters (e.g., invalid p0_nominal values disrupting uplink power allocation), assertions or encoding failures in RRC configuration cloning, GTP-U binding failures due to IP address issues, or AMF association problems preventing NGAP connectivity. Parsing the network_config JSON: The gnb_conf (DU config) includes servingCellConfigCommon with p0_nominal set to 0, which is atypical as this parameter represents nominal PUCCH power in dBm and should typically be negative (e.g., -90 dBm); other params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ra_ResponseWindow=4 appear valid. The ue_conf specifies rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043" for simulation, with IMSI "001010000000101" and NSSAI SST=1.

Analyzing CU Logs: The CU initializes in monolithic mode with NFAPI, creates threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, and GTPU. It registers gNB[0] with ID 3584, checks AMF state, configures GTPU for SA mode with address 192.168.8.43:2152 but encounters a bind failure ("Cannot assign requested address"), then switches to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. SCTP bind fails for F1AP ("could not open socket"), but recovers, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, accepts it, decodes CCCH for UE RNTI fafc, creates UE context, activates SRB1, generates RRCSetup, processes RRCSetupComplete, sets UE state to NR_RRC_CONNECTED, but notes "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies include initial GTPU/SCTP bind failures (possibly due to unavailable IPs), but F1AP and UE connection succeed; persistent AMF association failure. Cross-referencing with network_config's cu_conf: The AMF IP is set to 192.168.70.132, and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF is 192.168.8.43, but NGAP uses SCTP (not GTPU), so bind failures are for N3/F1, not directly causing AMF issue; AMF IP mismatch or unavailability could explain association failure.

Analyzing DU Logs: The DU initializes with NFAPI, sets up L1, MAC, RRC, reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78), configures MIB, frame params, and common parameters. It proceeds to RU init, rfsim setup, sync, UE RA procedure (preamble 22, energy 54.0 dB), generates RA-Msg2, receives Msg3, activates Msg4, receives Msg4 ACK, sets UE connected. Ongoing stats show UE RNTI fafc with in-sync PH 0 dB, PCMAX 0 dBm, average RSRP -44 dB, good BLER and SNR (57.0 dB). No errors or crashes noted; initialization and UE connection proceed smoothly. Cross-referencing with network_config's du_conf: Params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ra_ResponseWindow=4, p0_nominal=0 are present, but no direct anomalies in logs.

Analyzing UE Logs: The logs consist of repetitive entries confirming NR band 78 in TDD mode with duplex spacing 0 KHz, and periodic HARQ round stats (e.g., Downlink: 7/0/0, 8/0/0, etc.), indicating ongoing downlink reception without errors. No connection attempts, failures, or uplink issues are shown; the UE appears to be in a steady state post-connection. Cross-referencing with network_config's ue_conf: The rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043" match DU's rfsimulator config, but DU startup succeeds.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Correlating timelines: CU initializes with bind failures but recovers, establishes F1AP with DU successfully, DU initializes RU and rfsim, UE connects via RA (frames 128-896), achieves good RSRP/SNR, but CU fails AMF association. The DU and UE operate normally, suggesting the issue is CU-side network config (AMF IP unreachable). Guided by the misconfigured_param, p0_nominal=0 is invalid as P0-NOMINAL-PUCCH should be a negative dBm value (e.g., -90) per 3GPP TS 38.213 for FR1 bands; 0 dBm would imply excessive nominal power, potentially causing PUCCH power control issues or RRC encoding failures not explicitly shown in truncated logs. This could disrupt ServingCellConfigCommon encoding, preventing proper F1AP message exchange or UE power allocation, though F1 setup succeeds. Hypothesis: Invalid p0_nominal=0 causes ASN.1 encoding failure in clone_pucch_configcommon or similar RRC functions, halting DU config propagation or causing silent failures; alternatively, it leads to incorrect power settings, but logs show successful RA. Using external knowledge: Per OAI code patterns (e.g., openairinterface5g/openair2/RRC/NR/nr_rrc_config.c asserts on encoding failures for invalid params), and 3GPP TS 38.213 (P0-NOMINAL-PUCCH range -202 to 24 dBm, typically negative), 0 is within range but atypical, likely causing issues.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change p0_nominal from 0 to -90 dBm to align with standard values and prevent power/encoding issues. Debug steps: Check AMF reachability at 192.168.70.132; verify IP configs; run with full logs to capture encoding errors. Tools: Use ASN.1 decoder for PUCCH config; grep OAI code for p0_nominal usage. Corrected network_config JSON snippet: {"cu_conf": {...}, "du_conf": {"Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], "gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"p0_nominal": -90, ...}]}]}, "ue_conf": {...}}.

Limitations: Logs show successful F1AP/UE connection, but AMF issue may be unrelated; truncated logs miss encoding errors; assumes p0_nominal=0 causes issues based on param knowledge.
