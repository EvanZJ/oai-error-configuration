Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: DU initializes with config, starts rfsim server; CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP and to DU via F1AP; UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, performs PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session. Potential issues include invalid RACH config params causing ASN.1 encoding failures, asserts in RRC code, connection failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with servingCellConfigCommon including prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, rsrp_ThresholdSSB=200, SCTP settings, MACRLCs/L1s/RUs arrays, rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"server","serverport":4043}, log_config object, fhi_72 with fh_config. ue_conf has rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"127.0.0.1","serverport":"4043"}, imsi, etc. Initial mismatch: rsrp_ThresholdSSB=200 in du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0] likely invalid, as 3GPP TS 38.331 defines rsrp-ThresholdSSB as 0-127.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, initializes PHY/L1/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, sets up threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU. GTPU tries to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. NGAP registers gNB, checks AMF state. F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5. CU proceeds to wait for DU connection.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts, initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, configures serving cell with physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, rsrp_ThresholdSSB=200. Sets up TDD config, MIB, frame params. Then hits assertion: "Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!" in clone_rach_configcommon() at nr_rrc_config.c:68, "could not clone NR_RACH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding". Exits execution. Crash point is ASN.1 encoding failure during RACH config cloning, preventing further init and rfsim server start.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars, sets up 8 RF cards for TDD at 3.6192GHz, creates threads for UE/L1_stats/RRC/NAS. Runs as rfsim client, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails (errno 111: Connection refused). No connection attempts succeed, UE loops on connect failures. This is because DU crashed before starting rfsim server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crashes on RACH config encoding due to invalid rsrp_ThresholdSSB=200, preventing rfsim server start. UE fails to connect from start. CU starts but can't connect to DU via F1AP (remote_s_address="127.0.0.3" in cu_conf, but DU not running). Timeline: DU fails on config encoding, UE fails to connect immediately, CU proceeds but stalls on DU connection. Hypothesis: rsrp_ThresholdSSB=200 violates 3GPP TS 38.331 range (0-127, -156 to -30 dBm), causing ASN.1 encoding failure in clone_rach_configcommon, based on OAI RRC code patterns where invalid RACH params trigger asserts. No need for tools, as misconfigured_param directly indicates the issue.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].rsrp_ThresholdSSB from 200 to a valid value like 19 (-137 dBm). This should allow RACH config encoding, DU to start, provide rfsim server, enable UE connection. Debug: Check ASN.1 encoding logs, validate RACH params against TS 38.331. Further: Verify rfsimulator.serveraddr consistency ("server" vs "127.0.0.1"). Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... as is ...}, "du_conf": {... "gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"rsrp_ThresholdSSB": 19, ...}]}] ...}, "ue_conf": {... as is ...}}.
