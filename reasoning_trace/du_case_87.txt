Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode deployment with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) enabled, featuring a CU-DU split architecture. The expected flow includes component initialization (CU and DU threads, GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup), F1AP interface establishment between CU and DU, UE connection attempts via PRACH (Physical Random Access Channel) and RAR (Random Access Response), followed by RRC (Radio Resource Control) setup and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include configuration mismatches in PRACH parameters (e.g., invalid configuration index causing ASN.1 encoding failures), SIB (System Information Block) encoding problems, assertion failures in PHY/MAC code, connection timeouts, or excessive logging leading to performance degradation. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (from du_conf) includes servingCellConfigCommon with prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 (valid range 0-255 per 3GPP TS 38.211), dl_frequencyBand=78 (3.5 GHz), dl_carrierBandwidth=106 (100 MHz), ul_carrierBandwidth=106, ssPBCH_BlockPower=-25 dBm, and RU parameters like ru_thread_core=6 (valid CPU core), sl_ahead=5 (timing advance), do_precoding=0 (disabled), max_pdschReferenceSignalPower=-27 dBm (within range), sf_extension=0 (no extension), clock_src="internal", local_rf="yes". rfsimulator has serveraddr="server" (likely invalid, should be IP), serverport=4043 (default), modelname="AWGN", IQfile="/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs". ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1" (valid), serverport="4043". Initial mismatches: du_conf log_config.phy_log_level="trace" matches misconfigured_param, potentially causing log flooding; cu_conf has GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (may not be local interface), but recovers to 127.0.0.5.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization proceeds normally with monolithic mode, HW version logging, OPT disabled, PHY tasks creation, RRC/PDCP/SDAP setup, F1AP CU ID/name assignment, thread creation for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU/CU_F1. GTPU attempts bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails with "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99, likely invalid IP for local interface), leading to GTPU instance creation failure (-1) and E1AP CUUP N3 UDP listener failure. SCTP bind also fails with errno 99. However, CU recovers by rebinding GTPU to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully (instance 97), and F1AP starts. NGAP registers gNB, checks AMF state. F1AP receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU, assoc_id 1190), accepts it, sends F1 Setup Response with RRC version 17.3.0. No crashes or stalls; CU stabilizes after initial bind issues, waiting for DU/UE activity.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU logs are dominated by excessive PHY-level trace logging, showing repetitive measurements for slot 18 symbol 9 across RB 65-90, with aarx 0-3 (antenna receive ports) and n0_subband_power=0 for each. This pattern repeats without progression, indicating the DU is stuck in a logging loop or overwhelmed by trace verbosity, preventing normal operation like PRACH processing or RAR transmission. No initialization logs visible (truncated), but servingCellConfigCommon suggests TDD configuration with dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity=6 (5ms), nrofDownlinkSlots=7, nrofUplinkSlots=2. No explicit PHY/MAC errors or assertions, but the log flood implies phy_log_level="trace" is causing resource exhaustion or blocking, as trace level logs every subband power calculation in real-time.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE repeatedly attempts PRACH with selected RO (RACH Occasion) in frames 387-657, slots 19, symbol 0, placing PRACH at position 2828, msg1 frequency start 0, varying preamble_offset (0-15). Each attempt fails with "RAR reception failed" in MAC layer, indicating no RAR response from gNB. Harq round stats show 1/0/0 (1 attempt, 0 ACK, 0 NACK), confirming downlink reception but no RAR. UE is in a loop of PRACH transmissions without success, suggesting DU is not processing PRACH or transmitting RAR due to the logging overload. No connection establishment; UE remains in initial access phase.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU initializes successfully despite initial GTPU/SCTP bind failures (recovering to 127.0.0.5), establishes F1AP with DU, and waits. DU, however, is overwhelmed by phy_log_level="trace", flooding logs with subband power measurements (e.g., RB 65-90, aarx 0-3), likely consuming CPU/memory and blocking normal PHY processing like PRACH detection/RAR generation. This prevents UE RAR reception, causing repeated PRACH failures. Timeline: CU stable, DU logging loop starts immediately (slot 18), UE PRACH attempts begin around frame 387 and continue indefinitely. Hypothesis: Excessive PHY tracing in DU (from log_config.phy_log_level="trace") causes performance degradation, akin to log buffer overflows or CPU starvation, disrupting DU's ability to handle UE access. Network_config confirms phy_log_level="trace" in du_conf, matching misconfigured_param. No tool needed, as OAI logging levels are standard (trace > debug > info > warning > error), and trace floods PHY metrics.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change log_config.phy_log_level from "trace" to "info" in du_conf to reduce verbosity, preventing log flooding and allowing DU to process PRACH/RAR. Debug steps: Monitor DU CPU/memory during startup; use strace on DU process to check for blocking I/O. Tools: grep_search for "phy_log_level" in OAI code to confirm levels. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"log_config": {"phy_log_level": "info"}}} (change from "trace" to "info" to match cu_conf and reduce excessive PHY logging).
