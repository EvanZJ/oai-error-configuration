Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: DU initializes with config, starts rfsim server; CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP and to DU via F1AP; UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, performs PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session. Potential issues include invalid carrier bandwidth causing bandwidth calculation failures, asserts in common utils, connection failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with servingCellConfigCommon including dl_carrierBandwidth=0, SCTP settings, MACRLCs/L1s/RUs arrays, rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"server","serverport":4043}, log_config object, fhi_72 with fh_config. ue_conf has rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"127.0.0.1","serverport":"4043"}, imsi, etc. Initial mismatch: dl_carrierBandwidth=0 in du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0] invalid, as 3GPP TS 38.104 defines carrier bandwidths as positive MHz values.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, initializes PHY/L1/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, sets up threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU. GTPU tries to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. NGAP registers gNB, checks AMF state. F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5. CU proceeds to wait for DU connection.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts, initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, configures serving cell with physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_carrierBandwidth=0. Logs show "DLBW 0". Then hits assertion: "Assertion (0) failed!" in get_supported_bw_mhz() at nr_common.c:332, "Invalid band index for FR1 -1". Exits execution. Crash point is bandwidth calculation failure during serving cell config, preventing further init and rfsim server start.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars, sets up 8 RF cards for TDD at 3.6192GHz, creates threads for UE/L1_stats/RRC/NAS. Runs as rfsim client, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails (errno 111: Connection refused). No connection attempts succeed, UE loops on connect failures. This is because DU crashed before starting rfsim server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crashes on bandwidth calculation due to dl_carrierBandwidth=0, causing invalid band index -1 in get_supported_bw_mhz, triggering assert failure. UE fails to connect from start. CU starts but can't connect to DU via F1AP (remote_s_address="127.0.0.3" in cu_conf, but DU not running). Timeline: DU fails on config bandwidth calc, UE fails to connect immediately, CU proceeds but stalls on DU connection. Hypothesis: dl_carrierBandwidth=0 violates 3GPP TS 38.104 (expects positive MHz like 5,10,15,20,...), causing invalid band index in bandwidth utils, triggering assert in get_supported_bw_mhz. No need for tools, as misconfigured_param directly indicates the issue.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].dl_carrierBandwidth from 0 to a valid value like 106 (matching ul_carrierBandwidth). This should allow bandwidth calculation, DU to start, provide rfsim server, enable UE connection. Debug: Check bandwidth config logs, validate against TS 38.104. Further: Verify carrier bandwidth consistency. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... as is ...}, "du_conf": {... "gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"dl_carrierBandwidth": 106, ...}]}] ...}, "ue_conf": {... as is ...}}.
