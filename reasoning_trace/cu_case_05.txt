Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) mode deployment using radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for testing. The setup consists of three main components: CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment). Expected flow involves: component initialization → F1 interface setup between CU and DU → NGAP setup with AMF → UE random access (PRACH) → RRC connection → PDU session establishment. Key potential issues to look for include port configuration mismatches between CU and DU, network interface binding failures, and protocol handshake errors. The network_config shows cu_conf with local_s_portc=500 (potentially conflicting with DU port expectations), du_conf with remote_n_portc=501 (expecting CU to connect on port 501), and ue_conf with rfsimulator settings. Initial analysis shows port mismatch between CU local_s_portc=500 and DU remote_n_portc=501 causing F1 control plane connection failures.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization shows successful thread creation for TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1, and TASK_GTPV1_U. However, critical failures occur: SCTP bindx fails with "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99), GTPU initialization fails with bind error for address 192.168.8.43:2152, resulting in "can't create GTP-U instance" and "Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener". Despite these failures, F1AP setup succeeds with DU connection (assoc_id 21), UE context creation (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 48178), and RRC setup completion. The CU reaches NR_RRC_CONNECTED state but shows "No AMF is associated to the gNB", indicating NGAP connection failure. Cross-referencing with network_config, the cu_conf shows NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU both set to 192.168.8.43, which matches the failed GTPU bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization is successful with RU (Radio Unit) configuration using librfsimulator.so, proper antenna setup (4x4 MIMO), and TDD configuration for band 78. Random access procedure completes successfully: PRACH detection at frame 183.19, RA-Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchange, and contention resolution. UE achieves stable connection with good signal metrics (RSRP -44 dB, SNR 57.0 dB, BLER decreasing over time). Statistics show normal UL/DL traffic with increasing frame counts (256.0, 384.0, 512.0, etc.) and stable MCS 9. No PHY/MAC errors or assertions are present. The DU appears fully functional and can communicate with UE (via rfsim), but F1 control plane connection to CU is not established.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE shows repetitive band 78 TDD configuration confirmations and Harq round statistics progressing from 8/0/0 to 11/0/0 downlink rounds, indicating active communication. No connection failures or errors are evident - the UE appears to be successfully connected and exchanging data with the network via rfsimulator. The ue_conf shows proper rfsimulator configuration with serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043", matching the DU's rfsimulator settings.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The gNBs.local_s_portc=500 configuration in cu_conf creates a port mismatch with DU expectations. The CU is configured to connect to DU control plane on port 500 (local_s_portc=500), but DU is configured to receive connections on port 501 (remote_n_portc=501). This port mismatch prevents F1 control plane establishment, causing SCTP connection failures. The GTPU binding failures (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address") are symptoms of broader network initialization issues stemming from the F1 interface failure. Timeline correlation shows CU and DU initialize separately but cannot establish F1 connection due to port configuration mismatch, while DU-UE communication succeeds via direct rfsim interface. The port mismatch explains why F1AP setup partially works (data plane) but control plane fails, preventing proper AMF association.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change local_s_portc from 500 to 501 in cu_conf.gNBs to match DU's remote_n_portc configuration. Verify F1 control plane connection establishes properly after the fix. Test with corrected configuration to ensure SCTP/GTPU binding succeeds and AMF association works. Monitor F1AP connection logs during startup. If issues persist, check for additional port conflicts or firewall rules blocking the corrected ports.

Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "local_s_portc": 501  // Changed from 500 to 501 to match DU remote_n_portc
    }
  }
}
