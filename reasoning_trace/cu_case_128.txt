Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by logs showing --rfsim --sa options and UE connecting to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043. The expected flow is: CU init (threads, GTPU/NGAP setup) → F1AP setup with DU → UE connection via PRACH/RRC → AMF association for NGAP. Potential issues include config validation failures from invalid params (e.g., log levels), socket binding errors on non-local IPs, AMF association failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf) has log_config with ngap_log_level="invalid" (mismatch with misconfigured_param), AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43:2152, SCTP local 127.0.0.5. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", imsi "001010000000101". Initial mismatch: ngap_log_level="invalid" is invalid per OAI libconfig validation (expects strings like "info"/"debug"/"error").

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY/NR_PHY structures, allocates gNB_RRC_INST, sets F1AP IDs. Threads created for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. Key anomaly: GTPU bind fails with errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address" on 192.168.8.43:2152, can't create GTPU instance. SCTP bindx fails similarly, no SCTP connection. Fallback GTPU init on 127.0.0.5:2152 succeeds (id 97). F1AP starts, DU connects (assoc_id 167), F1 Setup Response sent. UE RRC setup succeeds (RNTI fd71, CU UE ID 1). Logs end abruptly, but no AMF association message, implying failure due to NGAP socket issues. Cross-reference: AMF IP 192.168.70.132 in config, but bind failures prevent NGAP socket setup.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RUs with rfsimulator, sets band 78 TDD, loads libs (librfsimulator, libdfts, libldpc). RU ready, syncs threads. PHY RF started, UE connects with preamble 10, RA procedure succeeds, Msg4 acked. UE stats show good RSRP -44dB, BLER low, data TX/RX ongoing. No crashes or assertions; DU-UE via rfsim working fine.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE repeatedly logs NR band 78 TDD duplex spacing 0 KHz, Harq round stats (8/0/0 to 11/0/0). No connection failures; seems stuck in loop but data flowing per DU logs. Links to ue_conf: frequency implied 3619200000 (from DU command line), rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" matches.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU init fails socket binds early (GTPU/SCTP on 192.168.8.43), falls back to local (127.0.0.5), F1AP succeeds, DU starts, UE connects via rfsim. But AMF association fails due to NGAP socket issues (logs truncated, but pattern matches previous cases). Misconfigured_param "log_config.ngap_log_level=invalid" guides diagnosis: Invalid string triggers config validation error in OAI (libconfig checks log levels), causing logging init failure. This corrupts init sequence, leading to bind failures on non-local IPs (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address" often from invalid config affecting socket setup). Fallback to 127.0.0.5 works for F1AP/GTPU, but AMF (NGAP) likely needs non-local IP, failing association. Hypothesis: Invalid ngap_log_level causes logging system failure, propagating to socket binding corruption, preventing AMF connection while allowing DU-UE via rfsim.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Update cu_conf log_config.ngap_log_level from "invalid" to valid string like "info" (matches other levels). Debug: Check OAI config_userapi.c for log level validation; run with --log_config.global_log_level=debug to trace init. Tools: Use grep_search on OAI code for "ngap_log_level" validation; fetch_webpage for 3GPP TS 38.331 if needed, but not here. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... "log_config": {"ngap_log_level": "info", ...}}, "du_conf": {...}, "ue_conf": {...}} (only ngap_log_level changed, others unchanged).
