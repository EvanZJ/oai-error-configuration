Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with monolithic mode (CU/DU combined). The expected flow is: component initialization (PHY/MAC/RRC threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, rfsim server startup for UE connection, PRACH/RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid UL BWP bandwidth values causing Msg3 allocation failures), GTPU binding errors (address conflicts), or rfsim server crashes after UE RA. Network_config shows gnb_conf (du_conf) with servingCellConfigCommon having dl_frequencyBand=78 (valid), physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth=28875 (valid), initialULBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 (invalid, causes UL BWP size=1 insufficient for Msg3), dl_carrierBandwidth=106, ul_frequencyBand=78. Ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatch: initialULBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 violates UL BWP bandwidth requirements, likely causing Msg3 allocation assert after UE RA Msg2.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, creates threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. Registers gNB[0] with macro id 3584, checks AMF registration. GTPU configures SA mode but fails to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 (address not assignable), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 and succeeds (instance id 97). F1AP starts at CU, receives F1 Setup Request from DU 3584, accepts and sends F1 Setup Response. No anomalies in CU init beyond GTPU address issues, which don't prevent F1AP. CU establishes connection with DU.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, configures RUs, starts rfsim server, waits for sync. All RUs ready, gNBs ready, sends sync to threads. RU 0 RF started, generates void samples. Receives UE connection, sends time. Processes RA procedure: initiates RA with preamble 4, activates RA process, generates RA-Msg2 DCI. Then hits assertion: "Assertion (rbStart < bwpSize - msg3_nb_rb) failed! In nr_get_Msg3alloc() ... no space to allocate Msg 3 for RA!". This crashes DU in gNB_scheduler_RA.c:860 during Msg3 allocation. Config shows parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 1, nb_ru 1. Crash occurs after UE RA Msg2 scheduling.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, configures 8 cards/channels for TDD, creates threads. Loads RFSIMULATOR device, connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 successfully after retries. Decodes SSB, syncs with PCI 0, adjusts frequency offset. Decodes SIB1, initializes RA procedure, selects RO, transmits PRACH. Receives RAR, processes it. Connection established but lost socket after RAR processing.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU starts successfully, F1AP connects to CU, rfsim server runs, UE connects and completes initial sync/SIB1 decode/RA initiation/RAR reception. DU processes RA Msg2 successfully but crashes during Msg3 allocation. Misconfigured initialULBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 triggers assertion in nr_get_Msg3alloc() (gNB_scheduler_RA.c:860), as UL BWP size=1 (from locationAndBandwidth=0) insufficient for Msg3 RB allocation (rbStart >= bwpSize - msg3_nb_rb). Valid range requires UL BWP bandwidth > msg3_nb_rb for RA. This invalid BWP size causes immediate DU exit during RA Msg3 scheduling. CU detects SCTP shutdown, releases DU. UE loses connection. Hypothesis: initialULBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 violates UL BWP bandwidth constraints, leading to Msg3 allocation assert. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid UL BWP config.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update initialULBWPlocationAndBandwidth to valid value (e.g., 28875 to match DL BWP). Debug by checking nr_get_Msg3alloc() for BWP size validation. Run with corrected config, verify DU handles UE RA Msg3 without assert. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": { ... (unchanged) },
  "du_conf": {
    ... (unchanged except servingCellConfigCommon[0].initialULBWPlocationAndBandwidth: 28875)
  },
  "ue_conf": { ... (unchanged) }
}
Explanation: Changed initialULBWPlocationAndBandwidth from 0 to 28875 (valid UL BWP config ensuring bandwidth > msg3_nb_rb for RA Msg3 allocation per TS 38.331).
