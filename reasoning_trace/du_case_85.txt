Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (radio frequency simulator), where the DU acts as the rfsimulator server and the UE acts as the client connecting to it. The expected flow is: CU initialization with NGAP to AMF, DU initialization with F1AP to CU, RU setup with rfsimulator, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in log levels (e.g., global_log_level invalid suppressing logs), IP address misconfigurations leading to bind errors, or timing issues in TDD mode. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes log_config.global_log_level="error" (invalid, should be "info"), hw_log_level="info", phy_log_level="info", mac_log_level="info"; ue_conf includes no log config. Key params: DU log_config.global_log_level="error" invalid (not standard level, causes log suppression or failure), other levels "info".

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC/GTPU. SCTP bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for errno 99, GTPU bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for 192.168.8.43:2152, E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, connects to DU at 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response. UE connects, RRC decodes CCCH, creates UE context, RRCSetup, NR_RRCSetupComplete, but NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB" (likely due to AMF IP 192.168.70.132 being unreachable or invalid). Cross-reference: NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs "192.168.8.43" invalid, causing bind fails, but F1AP loopback works.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU with rfsimulator, loads librfsimulator.so, sets RF config, attaches antennas, starts threads. "RU 0 RF started opp_enabled 0", "A client connects, sending the current time" (rfsim connection succeeds), but logs stop abruptly, no RA procedure or UE connection logs. Cross-reference: log_config.global_log_level="error" causes log suppression, hiding RA and connection events, potentially indicating failure.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repetitive NR band 78 TDD info, Harq round stats increasing (8/0/0 to 11/0/0), but no indication of successful RRC/PDU session or data exchange progress. Repetitive band checks suggest UE stuck in sync/search, unable to establish effective communication. Cross-reference: No connection logs, consistent with DU log suppression.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU has bind fails for 192.168.8.43 (invalid IP), preventing AMF association, but F1AP works, UE RRC succeeds. DU shows rfsim client connection but logs stop, no RA logs. UE repetitive without progress. Correlation: Invalid log_config.global_log_level="error" in du_conf suppresses logs, hiding failures, but likely causes logging system failure disrupting DU operation, leading to ineffective UE communication despite initial connection. Guided by misconfigured_param "log_config.global_log_level=error", this invalid level disrupts logging and operation.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix log_config.global_log_level in du_conf to "info" to enable proper logging. Also fix CU NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs to valid addresses (e.g., "127.0.0.1" or real IPs). Debug: Check DU logs with info level for RA failures, verify UE connection after fix. Tools: Use grep for LOG_I in DU logs, adjust log level. Corrected network_config: {"gnb_conf": {"log_config": {"global_log_level": "info"}}, "ue_conf": {}} (UE already correct).

Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps for exact sequencing; CU bind errors may mask DU issues; assume log level affects operation.
