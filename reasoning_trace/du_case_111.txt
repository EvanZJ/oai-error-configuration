Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves OAI 5G NR SA mode with rfsim, as evidenced by DU logs showing --rfsim --sa options and UE attempting rfsim connection. The expected flow is component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, UE random access (PRACH), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing failures from invalid structures, bind errors on network interfaces, or DU startup failures preventing rfsim server. Parsing network_config: du_conf has RUs=[], gNBs and other arrays present; cu_conf has gNBs object; ue_conf has rfsimulator settings. Initial mismatch: RUs=[] in du_conf violates requirement for at least one RU object.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPV1_U, CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode on 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails bind ("Cannot assign requested address"), leading to GTPU instance failure (-1) and E1AP CUUP N3 UDP listener failure. SCTP also fails bind on same address. Despite this, F1AP starts on 127.0.0.5, GTPU creates instance on loopback (97). Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest IP/interface issues, but F1AP proceeds on loopback. No F1 Setup Request received, indicating DU failure. Cross-reference: network_config cu_conf has NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU as 192.168.8.43, matching failed bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts config loading but hits "[LIBCONFIG] file ... - line 220: syntax error", "config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded", "Getting configuration failed". No further processing occurs. Links to network_config: du_conf has RUs=[], causing libconfig syntax error (empty array invalid for required RUs list).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes threads (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE), loads rfsimulator device, attempts connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but all fail with errno(111) (connection refused). No successful connection or RA. Links to network_config: ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1":4043, matching failed attempts.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines show CU initializes but waits for DU F1 Setup (not received); DU crashes on config syntax error; UE fails to connect due to no rfsim server. Root cause: RUs=[] in du_conf invalidates config structure, as OAI requires at least one RU object in RUs array for valid config parsing. Empty array causes libconfig syntax error, preventing DU startup and rfsim server. CU bind issues unrelated but compound problem. Hypothesis: RUs must contain valid RU objects for config to parse correctly.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf RUs to include proper RU object (e.g., with local_rf, nb_tx, etc.). For CU bind, verify 192.168.8.43 interface. Debug: Check OAI config schema for RUs array requirements. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"RUs": [{"local_rf": "yes", "nb_tx": 4, ...}]}} (full object as in previous cases). Limitations: Logs truncated; syntax error prevents further DU logs.
