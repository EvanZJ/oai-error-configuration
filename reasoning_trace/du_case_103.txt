Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves OAI 5G NR SA mode with rfsim for radio simulation, as evidenced by DU logs attempting to load config and UE logs trying to connect to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043. The expected flow is component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, UE random access (PRACH), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing failures in libconfig (e.g., syntax errors from invalid JSON values), bind errors on network interfaces, or mismatches in fhi_72 configurations causing DU startup failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes fhi_72 set to null; ue_conf has rfsimulator settings matching DU. Initial mismatch: fhi_72=null in du_conf, which violates object type requirements for fronthaul config in fronthaul specs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPV1_U, CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode on 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails to bind ("Cannot assign requested address"), leading to GTPU instance creation failure (-1) and E1AP CUUP N3 UDP listener failure. SCTP also fails bind on same address. Despite this, F1AP starts successfully on 127.0.0.5, but no F1 Setup Request received (logs truncated). Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest IP/interface issues, but CU proceeds; no DU connection due to DU failure. Cross-reference: network_config cu_conf has NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU as 192.168.8.43, matching failed bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU attempts config loading but fails with "[LIBCONFIG] file ... du_case_103.conf - line 252: syntax error", "config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded", "Getting configuration failed". No further initialization occurs; DU does not start. Links to network_config: du_conf has fhi_72=null, causing libconfig parsing failure (expects object, not null).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes threads, configures HW for rfsim client, tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails with errno(111) (connection refused). No successful connection or RA procedure. Links to network_config: ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr 127.0.0.1:4043, but DU failure prevents server startup.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines show DU config failure prevents DU startup, no F1AP to CU, no rfsim server for UE. CU initializes but waits for DU; UE fails to connect. Root cause: fhi_72=null in du_conf invalidates config file (libconfig expects object), causing syntax error and DU load failure. In hardware mode, fhi_72 validation would enforce object type; rfsim mode still requires valid config parsing. Hypothesis: Null value violates JSON/object requirements for fhi_72 in 3GPP TS 38.801 fronthaul specs, leading to libconfig failure. CU bind issues unrelated, likely due to interface config (192.168.8.43 not available). Misconfigured param directly causes DU startup failure.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update fhi_72 to valid object (e.g., with dpdk_devices, system_core, etc.). For CU bind, verify 192.168.8.43 interface or use loopback. Debug: Check libconfig syntax in config file; run without fhi_72 if not needed. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"fhi_72": {"dpdk_devices": ["0000:ca:02.0"], "system_core": 0, "io_core": 4, "worker_cores": [2], "ru_addr": ["e8:c7:4f:25:80:ed"], "mtu": 9000, "fh_config": [{"T1a_cp_dl": [285,429], "T1a_cp_ul": [285,429], "T1a_up": [96,196], "Ta4": [110,180], "ru_config": {"iq_width": 9, "iq_width_prach": 9}, "prach_config": {"kbar": 0}}]}}}. Limitations: Logs truncated; DU failure prevents full flow.
