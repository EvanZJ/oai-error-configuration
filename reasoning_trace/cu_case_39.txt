Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) setup in CU/DU split mode with rfsim for UE simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in the CU and DU command lines. The expected flow is: CU initializes and starts NGAP/AMF connection, DU initializes PHY/MAC and connects to CU via F1AP/SCTP, UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, then proceeds to PRACH/RACH, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., missing or invalid gNB sections), bind failures (e.g., invalid IPs), connection timeouts, or assertions in code. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs as an empty list [], gNBs section with gNB_ID "0xe00", local_s_address "127.0.0.5", remote_s_address "127.0.0.3", amf_ip_address "192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF "192.168.8.43". du_conf has Active_gNBs ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with gNB_ID "0xe00", local_n_address "127.0.0.3", remote_n_address "127.0.0.5", rfsimulator serveraddr "server". ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", serverport "4043". Initial mismatch: cu_conf Active_gNBs=[] suggests no gNBs active, conflicting with du_conf having one active DU gNB, and misconfigured_param "Active_gNBs=[]" directly points to this as the issue.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode (nfapi running), gets GNBSParams, OPT disabled, HW version logged, PHY creates tasks, then hits Assertion (num_gnbs == 1) failed! in RCconfig_verify() at gnb_config.c:648, with "need to have a gNBs section, but 0 found", followed by "Exiting execution". Command line shows -O /home/sionna/evan/CursorAutomation/cursor_gen_conf/auto_run_gnb_ue/cu_case_39.conf, libconfig loaded, parallel_conf 2, worker_conf 1, Configuration nb_rrc_inst 0, nb_nr_L1_inst 0, nb_ru 0 (indicating RAU/RRU config), then exits with _Assert_Exit_. No AMF connection or GTPU/NGAP setup occurs due to early exit. Anomalies: Incomplete logs (no further init), stalled at config verification, no threads or interfaces started beyond assertion.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts with ngran_DU: Configuring Cell 0 for TDD, command line -O /home/sionna/evan/CursorAutomation/cursor_gen_conf/baseline_conf/du_gnb.conf, libconfig loaded, parallel_conf 2, worker_conf 1, Configuration nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 1, nb_ru 1 (RAU/RRU), initializes northbound interface for L1, DL/UL frequency 3619200000, F1AP interfaces for MACRLC, MeasurementTimingConfiguration logged, PHY create_gNB_tasks with RC.nb_nr_L1_inst:1, l1_north_init_gNB, callbacks installed, gNB_RRC_INST allocated, SDAP disabled, RRC no preferred ciphering/integrity (defaults applied), threads for SCTP/GNB_APP/GTPV1_U/DU_F1 created, gNB 0 initialized, F1AP starting at DU, F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, GTPU UDP init 127.0.0.3:2152, gtpu instance 98, then SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused, F1AP retrying, repeated failures. PHY RU GPIO/generic, clock internal, L1 instances 1, RU 1, CPU cores 20, RU proc 0 initialized, thread pool, waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio, continued SCTP failures. No crash, but stuck retrying F1AP connection. Anomalies: No F1 Setup success, repeated Connection refused (errno 111), indicating CU not listening.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY samples_per_subframe 61440, UE vars for gNB TXant 1 RXant 1, prs_config skipped, symbol rotation for 3619200000 Hz, N_TA_offset 800, HW configuring cards 0-7 for TDD, tx/rx freq 3619200000, gains, UE threads initialized, TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE created, running as client to rfsimulator server, connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed errno(111) Connection refused, repeated attempts. UICC sim IMSI=001010000000101, etc. Anomalies: All connect attempts fail with errno(111), no successful connection to rfsim server, UE stuck in connection loop.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU exits early due to assertion on num_gnbs == 1 failing, as Active_gNBs=[] in cu_conf means 0 gNBs found, preventing any CU startup (no NGAP/AMF, no SCTP listen). DU initializes fully but F1AP/SCTP connect to CU fails with Connection refused, as CU isn't running to accept connections on 127.0.0.5:500/501. UE can't connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043, likely because DU's rfsimulator serveraddr is "server" (not "127.0.0.1"), but more critically, DU isn't activating radio due to waiting for F1 Setup Response, which never comes. Timeline: CU crash at start → DU retries F1AP indefinitely → UE retries rfsim indefinitely. Misconfigured_param "Active_gNBs=[]" directly causes CU config verification failure, as OAI requires at least one active gNB in CU config for split mode. Hypothesis: Active_gNBs in cu_conf should be ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"] to match gNBs section name, enabling CU startup and F1AP connection. No need for external tools, as OAI code (gnb_config.c) validates num_gnbs > 0.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix cu_conf Active_gNBs from [] to ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"] to enable CU startup and F1AP connection. Also, align du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr from "server" to "127.0.0.1" for UE connection. Debug: Run CU separately, check logs for assertion pass, then DU for F1AP success, then UE for rfsim connect. Tools: Use grep in OAI codebase for RCconfig_verify to confirm validation logic. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], ...}, "du_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", ...}}, "ue_conf": {...}}.
