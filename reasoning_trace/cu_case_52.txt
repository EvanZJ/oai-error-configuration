Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) setup using radio frequency simulation (rfsim) mode, as indicated by logs showing rfsimulator configurations and UE connection attempts. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1 interface setup between CU and DU, NGAP setup between CU and AMF, UE connection via PRACH/RACH to DU, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include configuration validation failures causing early exits, bind errors on network interfaces, AMF connection failures, or UE-side connection failures due to missing servers. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has plmn_list.mcc=-1 (invalid, should be 0-999); du_conf has plmn_list[0].mcc=1 (valid); other params include AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU addresses 192.168.8.43/127.0.0.5, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 in du_conf. Initial mismatch: MCC=-1 invalid per OAI config check (authorized range 0-999).

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts initialization, but config check fails: "mcc: -1 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999", then "config_execcheck: section gNBs.[0].plmn_list.[0] 1 parameters with wrong value", and exits with "Exiting OAI softmodem". No further init. Anomalies: Immediate exit due to invalid config. Cross-reference: plmn_list.mcc=-1 in cu_conf, invalid per OAI (common/config/config_userapi.c checks range).

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, starts F1AP at DU, attempts SCTP connect to CU at 127.0.0.5, but "Connect failed: Connection refused", retries multiple times. Waiting for F1 Setup Response. No crash, but stuck retrying. Anomalies: SCTP connect refused, no F1 setup. Cross-reference: CU exited, so no server running.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, configures HW for rfsim, attempts connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, but "connect() failed, errno(111)", retries multiple times. No connection established. Anomalies: Connection refused, retries. Cross-reference: DU not fully started (waiting for F1), so rfsim server not active.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU exits immediately due to invalid MCC=-1, preventing F1AP server startup. DU retries F1AP connect to non-existent CU server. UE retries rfsim connect to non-existent DU server. Misconfigured param "gNBs.plmn_list.mcc=-1" triggers OAI config validation failure (config_check_intrange in common/config/config_userapi.c), causing early exit. Per 3GPP TS 23.003, MCC is 3 digits (0-999), -1 invalid. Advance knowledge: Invalid PLMN params cause OAI to abort init, halting entire setup.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change cu_conf gNBs plmn_list mcc from -1 to 1 (valid value, matches DU). This allows CU to start, enabling F1AP and rfsim servers. Debug: Check config validation logs, ensure PLMN consistency. Tools: Run OAI with --help for param ranges. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"plmn_list": {"mcc": 1}}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}} (only mcc changed in cu_conf).

Limitations: Logs truncated, config validation causes early exit, preventing further events.
