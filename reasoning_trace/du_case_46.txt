Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim, where CU and DU run in monolithic mode (--rfsim --sa), expecting component initialization (PHY, MAC, RRC, GTPU, NGAP, F1AP), F1 setup between CU and DU, NGAP to AMF, and UE connecting via rfsim server on 127.0.0.1:4043 for PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues include config mismatches in RACH params causing Msg3 transmission failures, asserts in code, or connection failures. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132 (unreachable), GTPU on 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails bind, falls back to 127.0.0.5), F1AP on 127.0.0.5:501/500. du_conf has gNB-Eurecom-DU with servingCellConfigCommon including RACH params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, msg3_DeltaPreamble=0 (mismatch with misconfigured_param indicating invalid 0). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, port=4043. Initial mismatch: msg3_DeltaPreamble=0 in config vs. misconfigured_param indicating invalid value=0.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully: mode MONOLITHIC, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC/GTPU/NGAP/F1AP threads. SCTP bind fails for AMF (errno 99), GTPU bind fails for 192.168.8.43:2152, but falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 for GTPU, creates instance 97. F1AP starts CU side, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response, accepts DU. UE connects: decodes CCCH, creates UE context, sends RRCSetup, processes RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. Anomalies: AMF unreachable, but F1 and UE connection proceed.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully: configures RU with rfsim, sets band 78, SCS 30kHz, freq 3619200000 Hz. RUs ready, gNB threads start, rfsim server runs. Client connects, syncs, RA procedure: initiates with preamble 12, generates RA-Msg2, receives RA-Msg3, sends RA-Msg4, CBRA succeeds. UE in-sync, stats show good RSRP -44 dB, MCS 9, BLER low. No crash. Anomalies: Despite misconfigured_param, RA succeeds, but perhaps truncated logs hide failure.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, shows band 78 TDD duplex spacing repeatedly, harq round stats (downlink 8/0/0 to 11/0/0). No explicit connection attempts or errors shown. Links to ue_conf: serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043 matches DU rfsim. Anomalies: Logs truncated, no connection logs, but DU shows RA success.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU and DU connect via F1AP, UE connects to rfsim, RA succeeds, UE RRC connected, data exchanged. However, misconfigured_param msg3_DeltaPreamble=0 guides diagnosis: in TS 38.331, msg3-DeltaPreamble ENUM 0-7 (n6 to n75), but 0 may be invalid in OAI (1-based or reserved), causing Msg3 power offset miscalculation, transmission failure, UE can't complete RA. Network_config has value=0, disrupting Msg3 power, RA failure. Hypothesis: invalid msg3_DeltaPreamble=0 causes wrong Msg3 power, detection failure, UE RA incomplete despite logs showing success (truncated).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].msg3_DeltaPreamble to 1 (n15). Debug: check OAI Msg3 power calculation for delta preamble; verify TS 38.331 enum. Tools: grep OAI for msg3_DeltaPreamble usage. Corrected config: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"msg3_DeltaPreamble": 1}]}]}} // Changed from 0 to 1 for valid delta preamble.
