Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, with CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment) components. The expected flow is: CU initializes and validates config, starts NGAP to AMF and F1AP to DU; DU initializes, connects to CU via F1AP/SCTP, starts rfsim server; UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH/RRC connection, establishes PDU session. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid security params causing early exits), SCTP connection failures (e.g., CU not running), or rfsim connection issues (e.g., DU not starting server). The network_config shows cu_conf with security.drb_integrity="invalid" (should be "yes"/"no"), du_conf with standard TDD params and rfsim server on 127.0.0.1:4043, ue_conf with rfsim client connecting to same. Initial mismatch: drb_integrity="invalid" in cu_conf, which is invalid per 3GPP TS 33.501 (integrity algorithms nia0-nia3, but drb_integrity is a yes/no flag for enabling integrity on DRBs).

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode with --rfsim --sa, loads config from cu_case_120.conf, initializes structures, sets up gNB_RRC_INST, F1AP with gNB_CU_id 3584 and name "gNB-Eurecom-CU", SDAP disabled, 1 DRB. Then, "do_SIB23_NR, size 9" indicates SIB encoding prep. But then critical error: "[RRC]   in configuration file, bad drb_integrity value 'invalid', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed". This is a config validation failure in RRC module, likely in config_userapi.c or rrc_config.c, where libconfig parses security params and rejects invalid strings. No further init (e.g., no NGAP start, no AMF connection), logs end abruptly, indicating CU exits early due to invalid config. Cross-ref with network_config.cu_conf.security: drb_integrity="invalid" matches the error.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts with --rfsim --sa, loads du_gnb.conf, configures TDD cell, sets up F1 interfaces for MACRLC, initializes northbound for L1, creates threads (SCTP, GTPV1_U, DU_F1), initializes PHY for gNB 0, starts F1AP at DU with IP 127.0.0.3 connecting to CU 127.0.0.5, binds GTPU to 127.0.0.3:2152. Then repeated "[SCTP]   Connect failed: Connection refused" and "[F1AP]   Received unsuccessful result for SCTP association (3), instance 0, cnx_id 0, retrying...". DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio ("waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio"). No crash, but stuck in retry loop. Cross-ref with network_config.du_conf: SCTP params look valid, but CU not running prevents connection.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim, sets up PHY for TDD at 3619200000 Hz, configures HW cards (8 channels), creates threads (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE), loads UICC sim with IMSI=001010000000101. Then "[HW]   Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side", tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but "connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)" (ECONNREFUSED). Keeps retrying indefinitely. No RRC/PRACH attempts, as rfsim connection fails. Cross-ref with network_config.ue_conf.rfsimulator: serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043", matches DU's rfsimulator.serverport=4043, but DU not starting server due to CU connection failure.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU fails config validation on drb_integrity="invalid", exits early without starting NGAP/F1AP servers, so DU's SCTP connects to CU fail (connection refused), DU waits indefinitely for F1 setup, doesn't activate radio or start rfsim server. UE can't connect to rfsim server (no server running), retries fail. Timeline: CU error at init, DU retries start immediately, UE retries start after init. Root cause: misconfigured_param "security.drb_integrity=invalid" causes libconfig parse failure in CU RRC config, per OAI code (e.g., config_userapi.c checks security params), leading to early exit. Guided by misconfigured_param, this invalid string triggers validation error, unlike valid "yes"/"no" which enable/disable DRB integrity per TS 33.501. No tools needed, as logs directly show error and config mismatch.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set security.drb_integrity to "yes" (enables integrity) or "no" (disables) in cu_conf. Debug: Check OAI logs for config errors, validate params against paramdef.h. Tools: If spec details needed, search 3GPP TS 33.501 for drb_integrity. Corrected network_config.cu_conf.security: {"ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"], "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2","nia0"], "drb_ciphering": "yes", "drb_integrity": "yes"}. Other configs unchanged.
