Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads, GTPU/Ngap/F1AP setup), DU serving cell config parsing and MIB generation, rfsim server startup by DU, UE connection to rfsim server, PRACH/RACH procedure, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing errors in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid p0_NominalWithGrant causing ASN.1 encoding failures in PUSCH config cloning), assertions in RRC config functions, or network interface binding failures preventing proper inter-component communication. Parsing network_config: cu_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (fails initially due to address issues, falls back to 127.0.0.5), F1AP ports 501/500. du_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-DU with servingCellConfigCommon including physCellId=0, dl_frequencyBand=78, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, p0_NominalWithGrant=200 (noted as potentially invalid high value), ssb_periodicityServingCell=2, subcarrierSpacing=1, TDD config with 7 DL slots/6 symbols, 2 UL slots/4 symbols. ue_conf shows IMSI=001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043. Initial mismatch: p0_NominalWithGrant=200 in du_conf servingCellConfigCommon seems excessively high compared to typical dBm ranges.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB_RRC_INST, sets up threads (SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, CU_F1), registers gNB with AMF, configures GTPU initially to 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails with "Cannot assign requested address" and bind failure, leading to "can't create GTP-U instance"), then retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 (succeeds, creates instance 97), starts F1AP at CU with SCTP socket to 127.0.0.5. No anomalies in CU beyond initial GTPU bind failure (likely due to network config mismatch), but CU proceeds to wait for DU connection via F1AP.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes, reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78, ABSFREQPOINTA 640008, DLBW 106, RACH_TargetReceivedPower -96), configures NR band 78 TDD, sets TDD period to 6, configures MIB (Nid_cell 0, DL/UL freq 3619200000), initializes frame params (mu 1, N_RB 106), sets PUSCH Target 200 (matches p0_NominalWithGrant=200), then hits assertion "Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!" in clone_pusch_configcommon() at nr_rrc_config.c:85, "could not clone NR_PUSCH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding", causing DU exit. Crash point is during PUSCH config cloning, preventing further init like rfsim server startup.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, configures HW for 8 cards (TX/RX freq 3619200000, duplex TDD), creates threads (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE), simulates UICC (IMSI=001010000000101), attempts repeated connections to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, all fail with errno(111) "Connection refused". No connection attempts succeed, indicating rfsim server not started by DU.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crash in clone_pusch_configcommon() prevents rfsim server startup, causing UE connect failures (errno 111). CU initializes successfully but waits for DU via F1AP. Misconfigured p0_NominalWithGrant=200 in servingCellConfigCommon causes ASN.1 encoding failure in PUSCH config cloningâ€”per 3GPP TS 38.331, p0-NominalWithGrant is integer -202 to 24 dBm for PUSCH power control, 200 exceeds max (24), leading to invalid encoding buffer size (enc_rval.encoded invalid), triggering assertion. Network_config confirms p0_NominalWithGrant=200 in du_conf, matching DU log "PUSCH Target 200". No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid high value violating spec range.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf servingCellConfigCommon p0_NominalWithGrant from 200 to valid value like -90 (matching p0_nominal for consistency, within -202 to 24 range). Debug: Re-run with fixed config, check DU logs for successful PUSCH cloning, verify rfsim server starts (UE connects). Further analysis: Validate all servingCellConfigCommon params against TS 38.331 ranges using grep_search on OAI code for assertions. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {... "servingCellConfigCommon": [{"p0_NominalWithGrant": -90, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}.
