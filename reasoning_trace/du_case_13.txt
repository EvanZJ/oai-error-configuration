Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: The scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) in Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulator (rfsim), as indicated by the command-line options --rfsim --sa in the logs. The expected flow is component initialization (CU, DU, UE), followed by F1/NGAP setup between CU and DU, AMF connection, UE attachment via PRACH, RRC connection establishment, and PDU session setup. Potential issues include configuration mismatches in PRACH parameters, SIB encoding errors, assertion failures in the code, and connection failures due to invalid frequencies or addresses. Parsing the network_config JSON: gnb_conf (DU config) includes absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_frequencyBand=78, absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, dl_carrierBandwidth=106, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, and other parameters like subcarrierSpacing=1. ue_conf includes rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043, and IMSI=001010000000101. Initial mismatches noted: The config sets absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, but the DU log shows ABSFREQSSB=660960, suggesting possible parsing error, override, or different config instance; the SSB frequency calculation from 660960 yields 3914400000 Hz, which may not align with band 78 requirements.

Analyzing CU Logs: The CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, and GTPU. It sets gNB_CU_id=3584, registers with NGAP, and starts F1AP. GTPU attempts to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails with "Cannot assign requested address", then successfully binds to 127.0.0.5:2152. F1AP initiates SCTP connection to 127.0.0.5. No major anomalies, but the CU proceeds to wait for DU connection, with RRC entering main loop and accepting CU-UP ID 3584.

Analyzing DU Logs: The DU initializes, sets RC.gNB, configures PRB blacklist (0), L1 interfaces, and antenna ports (pdsch N1=2, N2=1, XP=2; pusch=4). It sets minTXRXTIME=6, SIB1 TDA=15, and disables CSI-RS/SRS/256QAM. RRC reads ServingCellConfigCommon with PhysCellId=0, ABSFREQSSB=660960, DLBand=78, ABSFREQPOINTA=640008, DLBW=106. The SSB frequency is calculated as 3914400000 Hz. An assertion fails in check_ssb_raster(): GSCN=8134 for SSB frequency 3914400000 Hz is outside the valid GSCN range for band 78, causing the DU to exit execution. This occurs during config validation, preventing further DU startup.

Analyzing UE Logs: The UE initializes PHY for 1 TX/1 RX antenna, skips PRS config, sets symbol rotation for f0=3619200000 Hz, and configures N_TA_offset=800 samples. It sets up 8 RF cards (0-7) with sample_rate=61440000, duplex_mode=TDD, tx/rx_freq=3619200000 Hz. Threads for UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE are created. As a client, it attempts to connect to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043, but connect() fails repeatedly with errno=111 (Connection refused), indicating the server is not running.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The DU crashes early in initialization due to an invalid SSB frequency (3914400000 Hz), which does not lie on the synchronization raster for band 78 (GSCN=8134 exceeds the valid range of 7711-8051 for SSB SCS=30 kHz). This prevents the DU from starting the rfsim server, causing UE connection attempts to fail. The CU initializes successfully but waits indefinitely for DU. The misconfigured parameter absoluteFrequencySSB=641280 (though logs show 660960, possibly due to parsing or override) leads to this invalid frequency. Guided by the misconfigured parameter, the root cause is an incorrect absoluteFrequencySSB value resulting in SSB frequency not compliant with 3GPP TS 38.101-1 synchronization raster for band n78. Using external knowledge from 3GPP TS 38.104 and OAI code (nr_common.c check_ssb_raster), the GSCN must be within band-specific ranges; here, 8134 > 8051 violates this, triggering the assertion.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update absoluteFrequencySSB to a valid ARFCN yielding GSCN within 7711-8051, e.g., 641032 (calculates to ~3615 MHz, GSCN~7926). Debug steps: Verify config parsing, check for overrides in gnb_config.c, use OAI logs with increased verbosity. Tools: Review 3GPP TS 38.101-1 Table 5.4.3.3-1 for GSCN ranges, run OAI with --log_config.global_log_level=debug. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"absoluteFrequencySSB": "641032"}]}]}} â€“ this changes absoluteFrequencySSB from 641280 to 641032, ensuring SSB frequency ~3615480000 Hz (GSCN~7926, valid for band 78).

Limitations: Logs lack timestamps, are truncated, and show ABSFREQSSB=660960 despite config absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, suggesting possible config mismatch or parsing issue; incomplete JSON may omit relevant parameters like ssbSubcarrierSpacing.
