Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (--rfsim --sa options), where CU, DU, and UE components run in monolithic mode. Expected flow: DU initializes first (parsing config, setting up L1/PHY/MAC), starts rfsimulator server for radio emulation, then CU initializes (NGAP/F1AP setup, AMF connection), and UE connects to rfsim server for PRACH/RRC/PDU session establishment. Potential issues: Config parsing failures in DU (e.g., syntax errors in libconfig, empty arrays causing structural issues), bind failures in CU (IP address issues), UE connection failures to rfsim server if DU doesn't start. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs object with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43. du_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with one gNB, MACRLCs array populated, L1s=[], RUs array populated, rfsimulator with serveraddr="server" (but UE expects 127.0.0.1), fhi_72 with valid fh_config. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Mismatch: du_conf L1s=[] (empty array) vs. misconfigured_param "L1s=[]", indicating structural config error causing libconfig syntax failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully up to thread creation (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1, TASK_GTPV1_U). Registers gNB[0] with NGAP, checks AMF registration. However, GTPU bind fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), SCTP bind fails similarly, creating gtpu instance id=-1 and failing E1AP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5:2152, accepts CU-UP ID 3584. No further progress due to DU config failure preventing F1AP connection. Cross-reference: NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43 may not be available on this system, but primary issue is DU not starting.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU fails immediately at config parsing: "[LIBCONFIG] file ... du_case_137.conf - line 206: syntax error", config module libconfig couldn't be loaded, log init aborted, getting configuration failed. No further initialization occurs. Cross-reference: du_conf L1s=[] matches misconfigured_param, causing libconfig to fail parsing due to empty required array. L1s array must contain at least one L1 object for DU to configure properly.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY (samples_per_subframe=61440, UE vars for 1 TX/1 RX ant), configures HW for 8 cards (TDD duplex, freq 3619200000 Hz, gains 0/110), creates threads (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE). Runs as rfsim client, tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but connect() fails with errno(111) "Connection refused". No successful connection, so UE hangs in connect loop. Cross-reference: ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1 matches attempts, but du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (not 127.0.0.1), though primary issue is DU not starting server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU fails at config parsing due to libconfig syntax error from L1s=[] in du_conf, preventing DU startup and rfsim server. This causes UE connect failures (errno 111). CU initializes but can't establish F1AP to DU (no DU running), and has bind issues on 192.168.8.43 (possibly network config mismatch). Timeline: DU exits at config parse, UE starts connect loop immediately, CU proceeds to F1AP start but stalls. Hypothesis: L1s=[] violates OAI config requirement for at least one L1 definition in DU config (libconfig syntax error). This is a structural config error, not parameter value issue. Guided by misconfigured_param "L1s=[]", root cause is empty array preventing config parsing. No need for external tools, as OAI config patterns show L1s array must be populated.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix du_conf L1s from [] to array with one L1 object (num_cc=1, tr_s_preference="local_L1", tr_n_preference="f1", local_n_address="127.0.0.3", local_n_portc=500, local_n_portd=2152, remote_n_address="127.0.0.5", remote_n_portc=501, remote_n_portd=2152). This ensures libconfig parses correctly, allowing DU startup and rfsim server. Debug: Run DU alone first to verify config parse, check system IPs for CU bind issues. Tools: Use OAI logs with --verbose, check /proc/net/route for IP availability. Corrected network_config: cu_conf unchanged. du_conf: L1s: [{"num_cc": 1, "tr_s_preference": "local_L1", "tr_n_preference": "f1", "local_n_address": "127.0.0.3", "local_n_portc": 500, "local_n_portd": 2152, "remote_n_address": "127.0.0.5", "remote_n_portc": 501, "remote_n_portd": 2152}] (populate with standard L1 config). ue_conf unchanged. Limitations: Logs truncated at DU config failure, no timestamps for precise timing, incomplete JSON if more config sections exist.
