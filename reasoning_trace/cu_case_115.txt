Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by UE logs showing rfsim client connection and RA procedures, DU logs with rfsimulator server starting, and CU logs with SA mode GTPU. Expected flow: CU initializes with GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup, DU initializes with F1AP connection to CU, F1AP setup completes, radio activates, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session with AMF. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid IP addresses causing SCTP bind errors), NGAP association failures preventing PDU sessions, or rfsim connection issues. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf.gNBs) has gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-CU", tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list with mcc=1/mnc=1/mnc_length=2/sst=1, nr_cellid=123456789, tr_s_preference="f1", local_s_if_name="lo", local_s_address="127.0.0.5", remote_s_address=12345 (invalid integer instead of IP string), local_s_portc=501, local_s_portd=2152, remote_s_portc=500, remote_s_portd=2152, SCTP_INSTREAMS/OUTSTREAMS=2, amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU="192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: remote_s_address=12345 is invalid (should be IPv4 string like "127.0.0.3" based on DU's local_n_address), causing SCTP failures in logs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, registers gNB[0] with NGAP (id 3584), sets up threads. SCTP bindx fails "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99, invalid remote_s_address), SCTP socket open fails, GTPU configures for SA mode, binds to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails "Cannot assign requested address", GTPU instance -1, E1AP CUUP listener fails. Falls back to F1AP socket for 127.0.0.5 len 10, GTPU binds to 127.0.0.5:2152 (id 97), RRC enters main loop, receives F1 Setup Request from DU 3584 (gNB-Eurecom-DU), sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU, creates UE context CU UE ID 1 DU UE ID 47046 (rnti b7c6), activates SRB 1, generates RRCSetup, processes NR_RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. Anomalies: Early SCTP/GTPU bind failures, but F1AP proceeds with fallback to 127.0.0.5. No NGAP setup shown, ends with "No AMF is associated". Cross-reference: 192.168.8.43 is NGU address, but remote_s_address invalid prevents proper SCTP for NGAP.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, configures rfsimulator, waits for gNB L1, sets RU mask, loads libs, initializes random seed, sets RU buffers, waits for sync, RF device ready, sends sync. UE connects as client, sends time, RA procedure initiates with preamble 21, energy 56.4 dB, TC-RNTI b7c6, Msg2 DCI, Msg3 scheduled, contention resolution timer, Msg3 received, UE MAC context added, Msg4 generated, Msg4 Ack received, CBRA succeeded. Stats show UE in-sync, data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing), Harq rounds. No crash, successful RA/RRC connection. Anomalies: None apparent, DU operates normally. Cross-reference: DU at 127.0.0.3 connects to CU at 127.0.0.5, matches CU fallback.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE shows NR band 78 TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz, Harq round stats for Downlink (increasing from 8 to 11), no explicit connection attempts (truncated), but implies ongoing connection with stats. Anomalies: Logs repetitive band info, no failures shown. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches DU server, connection successful as per DU logs.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU fails initial SCTP bind due to invalid remote_s_address=12345 (integer not IP string), cascades to GTPU bind failure on 192.168.8.43, E1AP listener failure, but F1AP falls back to 127.0.0.5 and succeeds, DU connects, UE RA/RRC succeeds via rfsim. However, invalid remote_s_address disrupts NGAP SCTP connection to AMF, hence "No AMF is associated", blocking PDU sessions despite RRC_CONNECTED. Timeline: CU init fails on binds, F1AP/UE proceed but NGAP stuck. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "gNBs.remote_s_address=12345" invalidates SCTP remote address parsing in libconfig/OAI code, causing bind/connection failures (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address" for invalid addr). This blocks NGAP AMF association, per OAI param validation (expects IPv4 string). Guided by misconfigured_param, root cause is invalid remote_s_address type (int vs string), similar to prior cases. No tools needed, logs/code patterns confirm.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change remote_s_address from 12345 to valid IPv4 string, e.g., "127.0.0.3" (matching DU's local_n_address for F1AP SCTP). Debug: Check OAI config_userapi.c for SCTP address validation, use strace for SCTP connect calls, verify AMF reachability. Tools: If spec details needed, search "3GPP TS 23.501 SCTP endpoint configuration" or "OAI gNB remote_s_address parameter". Corrected config snippets: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3" /* Changed from invalid int 12345 to valid IP string for SCTP remote endpoint */}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}}.
