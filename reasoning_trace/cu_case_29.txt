Overall Context and Setup Assumptions:
This scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for User Equipment (UE) emulation. The setup uses a Control Unit (CU) and Distributed Unit (DU) split architecture, with F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) for CU-DU communication, NG Application Protocol (NGAP) for CU-AMF communication, and GTP-U for user plane (N3 interface). Expected flow: component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1 setup between CU and DU, UE random access (PRACH), RRC connection establishment, PDU session setup, and data exchange. Potential issues include configuration mismatches in security parameters (e.g., invalid integrity/ciphering algorithms), config validation failures causing startup aborts, or connection failures due to missing components.

Parsed network_config: cu_conf includes security with integrity_algorithms=["nia5", "nia0"] (nia5 invalid, valid are nia0-nia3 per 3GPP TS 33.501). du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (likely "127.0.0.1" or loopback). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Key mismatches: integrity_algorithms[0]="nia5" invalid, causing CU startup failure.

Analyzing CU Logs:
CU initialization starts normally: nfapi MONOLITHIC mode, gNB tasks, threads for TASK_SCTP/TASK_NGAP/TASK_GNB_APP/TASK_RRC_GNB. Then "[RRC] unknown integrity algorithm \"nia5\" in section \"security\"", causing abort. Logs show CMDLINE restart attempt, but "NRRRC 0: Southbound Transport f1" indicates incomplete restart or failure. No further CU activity (no F1AP, NGAP, GTPU setup).

Analyzing DU Logs:
DU initialization proceeds: config load, threads for TASK_SCTP/TASK_GNB_APP/TASK_GTPV1_U/TASK_DU_F1, F1AP start, GTPU bind succeeds (127.0.0.3:2152). But SCTP connect to CU (127.0.0.5) fails repeatedly ("Connection refused"), F1AP retries. "[GNB_APP] waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio". No radio activation, DU stalls waiting for CU.

Analyzing UE Logs:
UE initialization: PHY vars, HW config for rfsim, threads for UEthread/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE. Attempts connect to rfsimulator server 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly fail (errno 111 "Connection refused"), no server running (DU not fully started). No RA or RRC attempts.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis:
CU fails at config validation due to invalid integrity algorithm "nia5" (unknown, not in nia0-nia3). Startup aborts, no CU processes. DU starts but SCTP/F1AP connect fails (CU not listening), retries indefinitely, radio not activated. UE connect to rfsim server fails (DU not serving). Misconfigured_param "security.integrity_algorithms[0]=nia5" invalid per 3GPP TS 33.501 (NIA0-NIA3). OAI validates algorithms at startup, aborts on unknown. Root cause: invalid integrity algorithm causes CU config failure, preventing F1/NGAP setup, DU/UE failures.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis:
Fix config: change cu_conf security integrity_algorithms[0] to valid "nia2" (preferred) or "nia0". Debug: check OAI logs for algorithm validation (grep integrity_algorithms in gnb_config.c). Re-run; expect CU start, F1 setup, DU radio activate, UE connect to rfsim.

Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "security": {
      "integrity_algorithms": ["nia2", "nia0"]
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {},
  "ue_conf": {}
}
