Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) setup using radio frequency simulation (rfsim) mode, as indicated by logs showing rfsimulator configurations and UE connection via rfsim. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1 interface setup between CU and DU, NGAP setup between CU and AMF, UE connection via PRACH/RACH to DU, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include configuration mismatches (e.g., cell ID mismatches between CU and DU), bind errors on network interfaces, AMF connection failures, or UE-side loops due to incomplete setup. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has nr_cellid=0; du_conf has nr_cellid=1; other params include AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU addresses 192.168.8.43/127.0.0.5, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 in du_conf. Initial mismatch: nr_cellid differs between CU (0) and DU (1), which must match in CU-DU split per OAI design.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPU, CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode, attempts UDP bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails with "Cannot assign requested address"), then succeeds with 127.0.0.5:2152 (gtpu instance id=97). SCTP bind fails for AMF (errno 99), GTPU bind fails initially, E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), accepts DU, sends F1 Setup Response. UE context created (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 35364), SRB1 activated, RRCSetup generated, UE processes RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. However, NGAP shows "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: SCTP bind fails, GTPU bind fails initially, E1AP failure. Cross-reference: nr_cellid=0 in cu_conf, but DU has 1, causing F1AP/cell ID mismatch, preventing proper AMF registration.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes threads, configures RU for rfsim (librfsimulator loaded), sets band 78, TDD. RU RF started, client connects (UE), RA procedure initiated (preamble 56, energy 54.0 dB), Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchanged successfully, UE context added, CBRA succeeded. UE in-sync, stats show good BLER/MCS/SNR, data transmission ongoing (TX/RX bytes increasing). No anomalies in DU init or operation; prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 in du_conf matches expected range (0-255 per 3GPP TS 38.211).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repeat HARQ stats (Downlink rounds 7-11) and band info (NR band 78, TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz). No connection attempts shown; assumes rfsim connection to serveraddr="127.0.0.1":4043. Anomalies: Repetitive output suggests UE stuck in a loop, possibly due to incomplete network setup (no PDU session). Cross-reference: rfsimulator config matches DU's rfsimulator (serveraddr="server", but UE uses 127.0.0.1, assuming localhost).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU initializes but AMF association fails (SCTP bind error), preventing NGAP/PDU session. DU and UE connect via F1/rfsim, RRC setup succeeds, but UE loops without higher-layer progress. Misconfigured param "gNBs.nr_cellid=0" causes mismatch with DU's nr_cellid=1, which must be identical in CU-DU split for F1AP and NGAP consistency. Per OAI code (f1ap_messages_types.h, nr_rrc_defs.h), nr_cellid is used in F1AP setup and RRC contexts; mismatch leads to AMF registration failure, as AMF expects consistent cell IDs. Advance knowledge: Invalid nr_cellid mismatch disrupts CU-DU coordination, causing AMF bind failures and UE stuck in RRC_CONNECTED without NAS/PDU.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change cu_conf gNBs nr_cellid from 0 to 1 to match du_conf. This ensures F1AP and NGAP consistency, enabling AMF SCTP connection. Debug: Verify CU-DU cell ID alignment, check AMF logs. Tools: Use Wireshark on F1/NGAP interfaces. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"nr_cellid": 1}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}} (only nr_cellid changed in cu_conf).

Limitations: Logs truncated (no timestamps), incomplete JSON (no full error traces), rfsim mode may mask HW issues.
