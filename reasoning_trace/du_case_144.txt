Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: DU initializes with config, starts rfsim server; CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP and to DU via F1AP; UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, performs PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session. Potential issues include invalid SSB periodicity causing incorrect synchronization or spec violations, though rfsim may bypass some validations. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with servingCellConfigCommon including prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ssb_periodicityServingCell="invalid", SCTP settings, MACRLCs/L1s/RUs arrays, rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"server","serverport":4043}, log_config object, fhi_72 with fh_config. ue_conf has rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"127.0.0.1","serverport":"4043"}, imsi, etc. Initial mismatch: ssb_periodicityServingCell="invalid" in du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0] likely invalid, as 3GPP TS 38.331 defines ssb-periodicityServingCell as enumerated values like 0(ms5),1(ms10),2(ms20), etc.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, initializes PHY/L1/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, sets up threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU. GTPU tries to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. NGAP registers gNB, checks AMF state. F1AP starts at CU, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends response. UE connects, does PRACH, RRC setup, connects successfully. CU notes "No AMF is associated" but proceeds. No anomalies in CU, connection established.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts, initializes RUs, rfsim server, configures serving cell with physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ssb_periodicityServingCell="invalid". Sets up TDD config, starts rfsim server. UE connects, PRACH succeeds, RRC setup, data exchange ongoing. No crashes or assertions, simulation proceeds normally. However, invalid ssb_periodicityServingCell may cause incorrect SSB transmission periodicity in hardware mode.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, connects to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, performs PRACH, RRC setup, connects successfully. Data exchange shows good stats: RSRP -44 dB, BLER low, MCS 9. No connection failures, UE in-sync.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Simulation succeeds with UE connected and data exchange, but ssb_periodicityServingCell="invalid" violates 3GPP TS 38.331 (expects integer 0-5 for ms5 to ms160). In rfsim, validation bypassed, so no immediate failure, but invalid value could cause SSB periodicity issues in hardware (e.g., wrong sync signals). CU connects to DU, UE connects via rfsim. Timeline: DU starts with invalid param, rfsim server runs, UE connects successfully. Hypothesis: "invalid" string not recognized as valid enum, defaults or ignored in rfsim, but spec violation causes potential sync issues. No need for tools, as misconfigured_param directly indicates the issue.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].ssb_periodicityServingCell from "invalid" to a valid integer like 2 (ms20). This ensures spec compliance, correct SSB periodicity. Debug: Check SSB transmission logs, validate against TS 38.331. Further: Test in hardware mode to confirm sync issues. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... as is ...}, "du_conf": {... "gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"ssb_periodicityServingCell": 2, ...}]}] ...}, "ue_conf": {... as is ...}}.
