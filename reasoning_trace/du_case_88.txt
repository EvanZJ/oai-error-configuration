Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode deployment with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) enabled, featuring a CU-DU split architecture. The expected flow includes component initialization (CU and DU threads, GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup), F1AP interface establishment between CU and DU, UE connection attempts via PRACH (Physical Random Access Channel) and RAR (Random Access Response), followed by RRC (Radio Resource Control) setup, NGAP AMF association, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include configuration mismatches in PRACH parameters (e.g., invalid configuration index causing ASN.1 encoding failures), AMF connection failures (e.g., invalid IP or port), excessive logging causing performance degradation, or invalid log levels leading to verbose output floods. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (from du_conf) includes servingCellConfigCommon with prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 (valid range 0-255 per 3GPP TS 38.211), dl_frequencyBand=78 (3.5 GHz), dl_carrierBandwidth=106 (100 MHz), ul_carrierBandwidth=106, ssPBCH_BlockPower=-25 dBm, and RU parameters like ru_thread_core=6 (valid CPU core), sl_ahead=5 (timing advance), do_precoding=0 (disabled), max_pdschReferenceSignalPower=-27 dBm (within range), sf_extension=0 (no extension), clock_src="internal", local_rf="yes". rfsimulator has serveraddr="server" (likely invalid hostname, should be IP like "127.0.0.1"), serverport=4043 (default), modelname="AWGN", IQfile="/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs". ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1" (valid), serverport="4043". Initial mismatches: du_conf log_config.mac_log_level="warn" matches misconfigured_param (invalid level, standard is "warning"); cu_conf has GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (may not be local interface), AMF IP 192.168.70.132 (potentially unreachable).

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization proceeds normally with monolithic mode, HW version logging, OPT disabled, PHY tasks creation, RRC/PDCP/SDAP setup, F1AP CU ID/name assignment, thread creation for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU/CU_F1. GTPU attempts bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails with "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99), leading to GTPU instance failure (-1) and E1AP failure. SCTP bind also fails with errno 99. CU recovers by rebinding GTPU to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully (instance 97), F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU, assoc_id 1192), accepts it, sends F1 Setup Response with RRC version 17.3.0. RRC decodes CCCH, creates UE context (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 57575, RNTI e0e7), activates SRB1, generates RRCSetup for RNTI e0e7, processes NR_RRCSetupComplete, sets UE state to NR_RRC_CONNECTED. However, NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB", indicating AMF connection failure despite AMF IP configured as 192.168.70.132. No crashes; CU stabilizes but lacks AMF for NGAP/PDU session.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, waits for gNB L1, configures RU threads, loads rfsimulator library, sets up RU buffers, syncs threads, RF device ready, client connects (UE), RA procedure initiated at 183.19 with preamble 39, energy 56.4 dB, RA-RNTI 010b, TC-RNTI e0e7. Generates RA-Msg2 DCI, schedules Msg3 at 184.17, starts contention resolution timer. Receives Msg3 correctly, adds UE MAC context, activates Msg4 scheduling, generates Msg4 with 149 bytes payload, receives Msg4 ACK, CBRA succeeds. Periodic stats show UE in-sync (RSRP -44 dBm, PH 0 dB, PCMAX 0 dBm), increasing dlsch_rounds (up to 9), ulsch_rounds (up to 73), BLER decreasing (down to 0.00006), TX/RX bytes growing (up to 984 TX, 8376 RX). No PHY/MAC errors or assertions; DU operates normally, processing UE data. Link to network_config: prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 valid, TDD config with dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity=6 (5ms), nrofDownlinkSlots=7.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs are flooded with repetitive MAC-level messages: "NR band 78, duplex mode TDD, duplex spacing = 0 KHz" repeated dozens of times, interspersed with Harq round stats (7/0/0 to 11/0/0). This indicates excessive verbosity at MAC log level, likely due to invalid log level configuration causing default to verbose output. UE connects successfully (RA, RRCSetup, data), but repetitive logging suggests resource waste or loop in MAC processing, possibly due to AMF absence preventing PDU session, causing UE to retry or log excessively. No explicit connection failures; UE remains in connected state but logs flood.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU recovers from bind failures, establishes F1AP with DU, processes UE RRC setup successfully, but AMF association fails ("No AMF is associated"), preventing NGAP/PDU session. DU initializes normally, handles UE RA/Msg3/Msg4, data flows (increasing rounds, low BLER), no errors. UE connects but logs flood with repetitive MAC messages, correlating with misconfigured_param log_config.mac_log_level="warn" in du_conf. Hypothesis: "warn" is invalid log level (standard OAI levels: "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "trace"); unrecognized level defaults to verbose, causing MAC logging flood in UE (separate process but config-shared via F1). Excessive logging consumes resources, but connection succeeds; AMF failure is separate (IP 192.168.70.132 unreachable). Network_config confirms mac_log_level="warn" invalid; rfsimulator.serveraddr="server" invalid but UE uses "127.0.0.1", so connects. Guided by misconfigured_param, root cause is invalid mac_log_level causing UE log flood, potentially masking AMF issues.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change log_config.mac_log_level from "warn" to "warning" in du_conf to use valid level, reducing verbosity and preventing log floods. For AMF, verify IP 192.168.70.132 reachability, update to local if needed. Debug: Check OAI log level enums; monitor UE CPU during logging. Tools: grep_search for "log levels" in OAI code. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"log_config": {"mac_log_level": "warning"}}} (change "warn" to "warning" for validity).
