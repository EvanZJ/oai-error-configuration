Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, as indicated by the logs showing --rfsim --sa options and librfsimulator.so loading. The expected flow involves component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connection via PRACH/RRC, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include config mismatches in servingCellConfigCommon parameters (e.g., invalid restricted set config causing PRACH root sequence calculation failures), asserts in DU code during RACH config processing, or connection failures due to invalid PRACH configs. Parsing network_config: cu_conf includes AMF IP (192.168.70.132), GTPU address (192.168.8.43), and F1AP ports; du_conf has servingCellConfigCommon with restrictedSetConfig: -1 (invalid, as valid values are 0-2), band 78, SCS 1, PRACH index 98, and other params; ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch noted: restrictedSetConfig=-1 may cause DU to treat it as restrictedSetTypeB, violating OAI implementation limits.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization proceeds normally with monolithic mode, thread creation for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPV1_U/TASK_CU_F1, and F1AP start. Key events include F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ for DU connection (127.0.0.5), GTPU configuration with SA mode and address 192.168.8.43:2152 (but bind fails due to "Cannot assign requested address"), and F1 Setup with DU. Anomalies include SCTP bind failure ("Cannot assign requested address"), GTPU bind failure preventing CUUP N3 UDP listener creation, and logs truncated before UE connection. Cross-reference with network_config: AMF IP matches cu_conf, but binding issues suggest network config mismatch (e.g., address not available), not directly related to restrictedSetConfig but indicating CU-AMF communication failure.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization includes RU setup with rfsim (librfsimulator.so loaded), antenna ports, TDD config, and RACH config processing. Key events: Reading ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78), configuring common parameters from NR ServingCellConfig, and DL_Bandwidth:40. Anomalies include critical assertion failure: "Assertion (1==0) failed! In compute_nr_root_seq() ... Procedure to find nb of sequences for restricted type B not implemented yet" causing exit. Link to network_config: servingCellConfigCommon params like PRACH index 98, restrictedSetConfig=-1 are loaded, causing compute_nr_root_seq to treat it as restrictedSetTypeB (since -1 !=0 and !=1), leading to assertion as type B procedure is not implemented.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initialization includes HW configuration for 4 TX/RX channels, rfsimulator client connection attempts (multiple failures with errno 111), and logs truncated before successful connection or sync. No sync, SIB1 decoding, or RRC events noted due to DU crash. Link to network_config: ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" matches DU rfsim, but DU crash prevents UE connection.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU initializes and sets up F1 with DU, DU starts RU/rfsim and processes RACH config, but asserts in compute_nr_root_seq due to restrictedSetConfig=-1. UE attempts connection but fails repeatedly, likely due to DU crash preventing rfsim server operation. CU has network binding issues preventing AMF association, but DU crash occurs during config processing. Hypothesis: restrictedSetConfig=-1 is invalid per TS 38.331 (valid 0-2), causing OAI compute_nr_root_seq to treat it as restrictedSetTypeB (else branch), violating implementation limits as type B procedure is not implemented, leading to DU assertion failure. Guided by misconfigured_param "restrictedSetConfig=-1", root cause is invalid restricted set config value causing PRACH root sequence calculation failure in DU.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update restrictedSetConfig to 0 (unrestrictedSet) to ensure valid PRACH config processing. Debug steps: Check OAI compute_nr_root_seq for restrictedSetConfig handling; verify TS 38.331 compliance for restrictedSetConfig; run with corrected config to ensure DU startup and UE connection. Tools: Use ASN.1 decoder on RACH config messages; monitor DU logs for assertion sources. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"restrictedSetConfig": 0}]}]}} (assuming 0 for unrestricted set; adjust based on deployment needs). Limitations: Logs truncated, no UE post-crash logs; DU assertion prevents full flow testing; CU logs incomplete.
