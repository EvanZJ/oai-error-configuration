Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with CU/DU split architecture. The expected flow is: DU initializes PHY/MAC components, configures RU (Radio Unit), establishes F1AP connection to CU, starts rfsim server for UE connections, CU sets up NGAP to AMF, then UE connects via rfsim to DU. Potential issues include RU configuration failures (e.g., invalid antenna counts causing assertions), F1AP setup failures, or rfsim server not starting. Parsing network_config: du_conf.RUs[0] has nb_tx=0 (invalid, should be >=1 for transmit antennas), nb_rx=4, with logical antenna ports pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2, pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2, pusch_AntennaPorts=4 requiring physical TX antennas; cu_conf has AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU on 192.168.8.43; ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatch: nb_tx=0 violates physical antenna requirements for logical ports.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1), sets up GTPU on 192.168.8.43:2152 but bind fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), SCTP bind also fails. F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response, but then gets SCTP SHUTDOWN EVENT and releases DU. No AMF association succeeds due to DU crash preventing stable F1AP. Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest network interface issues, but primary issue is DU not staying up. Cross-reference: cu_conf.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU=192.168.8.43 matches failed bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes frame params (N_RB=106, mu=1), configures for TDD, sets up threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_DU_F1), F1AP connects to CU at 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Response. Then RU configuration starts: "configuring RU from file", "Creating RC.ru[0]", but assertion fails: "Assertion (RC.ru[j]->nb_tx >= num_logical_antennas) failed!" in NRRCconfig_RU() at nr-ru.c:2067, with message "Number of logical antenna ports (set in config file with pdsch_AntennaPorts) cannot be larger than physical antennas (nb_tx)". DU exits execution. Crash point is RU config due to nb_tx=0 being invalid. Link to network_config: du_conf.RUs[0].nb_tx=0, but servingCellConfigCommon has pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2, pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2, pusch_AntennaPorts=4 requiring >=4 TX antennas.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, configures 8 cards (sample_rate=61440000, TDD), sets TX/RX freq to 3619200000 Hz, starts threads (UEthread, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE). Tries to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but all connect() calls fail with errno(111) "Connection refused". No successful connection because DU crashed before starting rfsim server. Link to network_config: ue_conf.rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043" matches failed connection attempts.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timeline correlation: DU starts first, configures RU, assertion fails immediately due to nb_tx=0 < required antennas (pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2 + pdsch_AntennaPorts_N1=2 + pusch_AntennaPorts=4 = at least 4 TX needed), DU crashes before F1AP stabilizes or rfsim starts. CU waits for DU, gets F1 Setup then SCTP shutdown, can't proceed to AMF association. UE can't connect to rfsim server because DU never starts it. Root cause: RUs[0].nb_tx=0 invalid per OAI requirements - physical TX antennas must be >= logical antenna ports. Hypothesis confirmed by assertion message and config values. No need for external tools as misconfigured_param directly indicates issue.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set RUs[0].nb_tx to valid value >=4 (e.g., 4) to support logical antenna ports. Debug: Check OAI docs for RU antenna config, validate nb_tx >= sum of antenna port configs. Tools: Run with corrected config, monitor DU logs for RU config success. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {...}, "du_conf": {"RUs": [{"nb_tx": 4, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {...}}  # nb_tx changed from 0 to 4 to satisfy assertion nb_tx >= num_logical_antennas
