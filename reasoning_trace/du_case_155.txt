Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation with rfsim, CU/DU split. Expected flow: DU initializes, establishes F1AP SCTP connection to CU, starts rfsim server, UE connects, CU sets up NGAP to AMF. Potential issues: SCTP config invalid (streams=0), network interface binds failing, AMF association issues. Parsing network_config: du_conf.gNBs[0].SCTP.SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=0 (invalid, must be >=1 per RFC 4960), cu_conf.gNBs.SCTP.SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=2 (valid), cu_conf uses 192.168.8.43 for AMF/GTPU (may not be available). Initial mismatch: du_conf SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=0 vs cu_conf=2, potentially causing F1AP SCTP negotiation issues.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts, initializes threads, GTPU bind to 192.168.8.43 fails, SCTP bind fails, but F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response. UE connects via DU, RRC setup succeeds. But AMF association fails ("No AMF is associated") due to SCTP bind failure on 192.168.8.43. Anomalies: Bind failures suggest interface not configured, but F1AP works. Cross-reference: cu_conf.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43" matches failed bind.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, configures RU/rfsim, F1AP connects to CU despite SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=0, receives F1 Setup Response. Rfsim server starts, UE connects, RA succeeds, RRC establishes, data flows (TX/RX bytes increasing). No errors from SCTP config. Link to network_config: du_conf.gNBs[0].SCTP.SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=0 may be ignored or defaulted, but invalid per RFC 4960.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs show repeated band info, Harq stats (rounds 8/0/0 to 11/0/0), but DU logs confirm UE connects and data transfers. Link to network_config: ue_conf.rfsimulator matches DU operation.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timeline: DU starts with invalid SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=0, but F1AP SCTP connection succeeds (possibly defaults to valid value), CU establishes F1AP, UE connects successfully, data flows. CU fails AMF association due to 192.168.8.43 bind issues. Root cause: gNBs[0].SCTP.SCTP_OUTSTREAMS=0 invalid per RFC 4960 (SCTP streams must be >=1), though logs show success (likely defaulted), configuration is wrong and can cause F1AP failures in strict implementations. CU bind issues separate (interface unavailable).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set du_conf.gNBs[0].SCTP.SCTP_OUTSTREAMS to valid value >=1, e.g., 2 to match CU. For CU AMF issues, ensure 192.168.8.43 interface configured or use available IP. Debug: Check SCTP negotiation logs, verify streams >=1. Tools: Test with corrected config, monitor F1AP SCTP setup. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"SCTP": {"SCTP_OUTSTREAMS": 2, ...}}, ...]}, ...}  # SCTP_OUTSTREAMS changed from 0 to 2 for valid SCTP configuration
