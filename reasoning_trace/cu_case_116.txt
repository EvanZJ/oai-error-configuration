Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by UE logs showing rfsim client attempts and DU logs with rfsimulator server config. Expected flow: CU loads config, initializes with GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup, DU connects via F1AP, F1AP setup completes, radio activates, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues include config parsing failures (e.g., invalid IP values causing libconfig syntax errors), preventing component init, leading to connection failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf.gNBs) has gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-CU", tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list with mcc=1/mnc=1/mnc_length=2/sst=1, nr_cellid=123456789, tr_s_preference="f1", local_s_if_name="lo", local_s_address="127.0.0.5", remote_s_address="127.0.0.3", local_s_portc=501, local_s_portd=2152, remote_s_portc=500, remote_s_portd=2152, SCTP_INSTREAMS/OUTSTREAMS=2, amf_ip_address.ipv4=12345 (invalid integer instead of IP string), NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF/NGU="192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: amf_ip_address.ipv4=12345 is invalid (should be IPv4 string like "192.168.70.132"), causing config syntax error in logs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU attempts to load config from cu_case_116.conf, but hits syntax error at line 91, config_libconfig_init returns -1, config module not loaded, log init aborted, configuration failed. No further init, CU exits early. Anomalies: Immediate config failure, no threads or interfaces started. Cross-reference: amf_ip_address.ipv4=12345 invalidates libconfig parsing.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU loads config successfully, initializes RU threads, sets up rfsimulator, waits for gNB L1, RF ready, client connects (UE), but F1AP connect to CU 127.0.0.5 fails "Connection refused" repeatedly, retries association. No F1 setup, waits for response before radio activation. Anomalies: F1AP failures due to CU not running. Cross-reference: DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5, but CU config failed.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY for rfsim, configures HW cards, starts threads, runs as rfsim client, tries connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail errno(111) "Connection refused". Anomalies: Persistent connect failures. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches attempts, but server not started because DU not activated (no F1 setup).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU config parsing fails due to invalid amf_ip_address.ipv4=12345 (integer not string), causes libconfig syntax error, config module load failure, CU exits before init. DU starts but can't connect to CU via F1AP, retries fail. UE can't connect to rfsim server because DU waits for F1 setup, radio not activated. Timeline: CU fails immediately on config load, DU/UE proceed but fail on connections. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4=12345" invalidates config file syntax in libconfig, causing parse failure and early exit. This blocks CU init, cascading to F1AP/UE failures. Guided by misconfigured_param, root cause is invalid amf_ip_address type (int vs string), per OAI config validation (expects IPv4 string). No tools needed, logs/code patterns confirm.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change amf_ip_address.ipv4 from 12345 to valid IPv4 string, e.g., "192.168.70.132" (matching NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF or typical AMF IP). Debug: Check config file syntax with libconfig tools, validate IP formats in OAI docs. Tools: If spec details needed, search "3GPP TS 23.501 AMF IP configuration" or "OAI amf_ip_address parameter". Corrected config snippets: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"amf_ip_address": {"ipv4": "192.168.70.132"} /* Changed from invalid int 12345 to valid IP string for AMF connection */}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}}.
