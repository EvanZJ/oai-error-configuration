Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads, GTPU/Ngap/F1AP setup), DU serving cell config parsing and MIB generation, rfsim server startup by DU, UE connection to rfsim server, PRACH/RACH procedure, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing errors in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid pucchGroupHopping causing ASN.1 encoding failures in PUCCH config cloning), assertions in RRC config functions, or network interface binding failures preventing proper inter-component communication. Parsing network_config: cu_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (fails initially due to address issues, falls back to 127.0.0.5), F1AP ports 501/500. du_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-DU with servingCellConfigCommon including physCellId=0, dl_frequencyBand=78, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, pucchGroupHopping=-1 (noted as potentially invalid negative value), ssb_periodicityServingCell=2, subcarrierSpacing=1, TDD config with 7 DL slots/6 symbols, 2 UL slots/4 symbols. ue_conf shows IMSI=001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043. Initial mismatch: pucchGroupHopping=-1 in du_conf servingCellConfigCommon seems invalid compared to typical enumerated values.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB_RRC_INST, sets up threads (SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, CU_F1), registers gNB with AMF, configures GTPU initially to 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails with "Cannot assign requested address" and bind failure, leading to "can't create GTP-U instance"), then retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 (succeeds, creates instance 97), starts F1AP at CU with SCTP socket to 127.0.0.5. No anomalies in CU beyond initial GTPU bind failure (likely due to network config mismatch), but CU proceeds to wait for DU connection via F1AP.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes, reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78, ABSFREQPOINTA 640008, DLBW 106, RACH_TargetReceivedPower -96), configures NR band 78 TDD, sets TDD period to 6, configures MIB (Nid_cell 0, DL/UL freq 3619200000), initializes frame params (mu 1, N_RB 106), sets PUSCH Target 200, PUCCH Target 150 (matches p0_nominal=-90), then hits assertion "Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!" in clone_pucch_configcommon() at nr_rrc_config.c:102, "could not clone NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding", causing DU exit. Crash point is during PUCCH config cloning, preventing further init like rfsim server startup.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, configures HW for 8 cards (TX/RX freq 3619200000, duplex TDD), creates threads (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE), simulates UICC (IMSI=001010000000101), attempts repeated connections to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, all fail with errno(111) "Connection refused". No connection attempts succeed, indicating rfsim server not started by DU.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crash in clone_pucch_configcommon() prevents rfsim server startup, causing UE connect failures (errno 111). CU initializes successfully but waits for DU via F1AP. Misconfigured pucchGroupHopping=-1 in servingCellConfigCommon causes ASN.1 encoding failure in PUCCH config cloningâ€”per 3GPP TS 38.331, pucch-GroupHopping is enumerated {neither(0), enable(1), disable(2)}, -1 is invalid, leading to invalid encoding buffer size (enc_rval.encoded invalid), triggering assertion. Network_config confirms pucchGroupHopping=-1 in du_conf, matching DU log "PUCCH Target 150". No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid negative value violating spec range.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf servingCellConfigCommon pucchGroupHopping from -1 to valid value like 0 (neither). Debug: Re-run with fixed config, check DU logs for successful PUCCH cloning, verify rfsim server starts (UE connects). Further analysis: Validate all servingCellConfigCommon params against TS 38.331 ranges using grep_search on OAI code for assertions. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {... "servingCellConfigCommon": [{"pucchGroupHopping": 0, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}.
