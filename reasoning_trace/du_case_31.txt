Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA (Standalone) mode setup using rfsim (radio frequency simulator) for testing, as evidenced by logs showing --rfsim --sa options, rfsimulator server/client modes, and frequencies like 3619200000 Hz. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1AP (CU-DU) and NGAP (CU-AMF) setup, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC configuration, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include config mismatches in bandwidth parameters, assertions in common utility functions, connection failures due to component crashes. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (from du_conf) includes ul_carrierBandwidth: 0 (invalid, causes assertion), dl_carrierBandwidth: 106, pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP: 2, do_CSIRS: 1, maxMIMO_layers: 2, servingCellConfigCommon with dl_subcarrierSpacing: 1, ul_subcarrierSpacing: 1, dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity: 6, nrofDownlinkSlots: 7, nrofUplinkSlots: 2 (TDD pattern), prach_ConfigurationIndex: 98, ssb_periodicityServingCell: 2. ue_conf includes rfsimulator serveraddr: "127.0.0.1", serverport: "4043". Initial mismatch: ul_carrierBandwidth=0 in du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0] directly matches misconfigured_param, likely causing DU assertion.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads for NGAP, GTPU, F1AP, etc. GTPU bind fails on 192.168.8.43:2152 ("Cannot assign requested address"), but switches to local 127.0.0.5:2152. NGAP registers gNB[0] with AMF. F1AP starts, creates socket for 127.0.0.5. No DU connection or F1 Setup Response shown. Anomalies: GTPU bind failure (network config issue?), incomplete logs (no DU interaction). Cross-reference with network_config: cu_conf.gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4: "192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF: "192.168.8.43" (mismatch? 192.168.8.43 vs 192.168.70.132), but bind failure on 192.168.8.43 suggests IP not available.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes, configures common parameters from ServingCellConfig, sets DL_Bandwidth:40, NR band 78 TDD. Then "Assertion (0) failed!" in get_supported_bw_mhz() at nr_common.c:332, "Invalid band index for FR1 -1". Exits execution. Break down: Init succeeds until bandwidth calculation, crash point is invalid ul_carrierBandwidth=0 causing band index -1 in get_supported_bw_mhz(). Link to network_config: du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].ul_carrierBandwidth: 0 (matches misconfigured_param), causes assertion on invalid bandwidth.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY for 8 cards, sets freq 3619200000 Hz, loads rfsimulator as client. Tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail with errno(111) (Connection refused). No connection attempts succeed. Link to network_config: ue_conf.rfsimulator.serveraddr: "127.0.0.1", serverport: "4043" (matches attempts).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timeline: CU starts, DU starts and initializes, UE starts and tries connects. DU crashes on bandwidth assertion, preventing F1 setup. CU waits for DU, UE connect fails because rfsim server (DU) is down. Root cause: misconfigured_param "gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].ul_carrierBandwidth=0" invalid; carrier bandwidth must be positive (e.g., 5-400 PRBs). Zero value causes get_supported_bw_mhz() to compute invalid band index -1, triggering assertion. Guided by misconfigured_param, this is a known issue in OAI NR common utilities (get_supported_bw_mhz function checks bandwidth validity). No need for tools; based on 3GPP TS 38.104 (bandwidth ranges) and OAI code patterns.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change ul_carrierBandwidth to valid value (e.g., 106 to match dl_carrierBandwidth); ensure positive integer matching band capabilities. Debug: Check bandwidth consistency between DL/UL, verify against 3GPP TS 38.104. Tools: If needed, grep OAI nr_common.c for bandwidth validation or 3GPP TS 38.104 for NR bandwidths. Output corrected gnb.conf (du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0]) snippet: {"ul_carrierBandwidth": 106} // Changed from 0 to 106; ul_carrierBandwidth must be positive integer (e.g., 5-400 PRBs), zero causes invalid band index in get_supported_bw_mhz().
