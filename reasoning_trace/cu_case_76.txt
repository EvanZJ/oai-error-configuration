Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by GTPU SA mode and UE rfsim client connection. Expected flow: CU initializes, binds GTPU/NGAP interfaces, connects to AMF via NGAP, sets up F1AP to DU, DU activates radio/rfsim server, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Interface binding failures, AMF connection issues, but F1AP/rfsim may work. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has gNBs.amf_ip_address={} (empty object), NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43" and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="192.168.8.43". du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (mismatch with UE's 127.0.0.1). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch: Empty amf_ip_address likely invalid for NGAP AMF binding.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, etc.), starts F1AP at CU, binds GTPU to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 succeeds. F1AP SCTP creates socket to 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response, UE RRC setup succeeds (NR_RRC_CONNECTED). But "[NGAP] No AMF is associated to the gNB" – no AMF connection. Anomalous: GTPU bind fail on 192.168.8.43 (possibly invalid IP), but F1AP proceeds; NGAP stalls without AMF IP.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes fully: loads RU (librfsimulator), sets band 78, starts rfsim server, waits for UE connect. UE connects, RA procedure initiates (preamble 14), Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 succeed, UE in-sync with RSRP -44 dB, data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing). No PHY/MAC errors; rfsim generates samples, HARQ rounds increase. Links to network_config: prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 valid per TS 38.211.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE connects to rfsim server (127.0.0.1:4043), band 78 TDD confirmed, HARQ stats show successful DL reception (rounds 7-11/0/0). No connection failures; in-sync, data flowing. Links to ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1".

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU GTPU bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (invalid address?), but succeeds on 127.0.0.5 for F1AP. F1AP setup succeeds, DU activates rfsim, UE connects/PRACH succeeds. But NGAP has "No AMF associated" because amf_ip_address={} empty, preventing AMF connection per 3GPP TS 23.501 NG interface. Timeline: CU init partial (GTPU fail but F1AP ok) → DU waits F1 Setup (succeeds) → UE connects rfsim (succeeds) → but no AMF → no PDU session. Hypothesis: Empty amf_ip_address invalid; OAI requires AMF IP for NGAP. Guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.amf_ip_address={}", root cause is missing AMF IP causing NGAP failure, but F1AP/rfsim unaffected.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Populate gNBs.amf_ip_address with {"ipv4": "192.168.70.132"} or use NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF. Also fix du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr to "127.0.0.1". Debug: Check IP validity; use grep_search on OAI for amf_ip_address usage. Tools: web_search "OAI 5G amf_ip_address configuration" if needed.
