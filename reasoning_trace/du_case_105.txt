Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves OAI 5G NR SA mode with rfsim for radio simulation, as evidenced by DU logs showing "librfsimulator.so" loading and UE logs referencing rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043. The expected flow is component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, UE random access (PRACH), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures from unknown keys/values, bind errors on network interfaces, or mismatches in configurations causing DU startup failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes extra_key with invalid value; ue_conf has rfsimulator settings matching DU. Initial mismatch: extra_key="invalid" in du_conf, which violates valid config key requirements.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPV1_U, CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode on 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails to bind ("Cannot assign requested address"), leading to GTPU instance creation failure (-1) and E1AP CUUP N3 UDP listener failure. SCTP also fails bind on same address. Despite this, F1AP starts successfully on 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU with RRC version 17.3.0. UE context created (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 42091, RNTI a46b), SRB1 activated, RRCSetup sent, NR_RRCSetupComplete processed, UE in NR_RRC_CONNECTED state. No AMF association noted ("No AMF is associated to the gNB"). Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest IP/interface issues, but F1AP proceeds on loopback. Cross-reference: network_config cu_conf has NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU as 192.168.8.43, matching failed bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, loads librfsimulator.so, sets up buffers, waits for sync. RU configured with nr_band 78, TDD mode. RF device ready, generates void samples (no hardware). UE connects, RA procedure initiated with preamble 63, Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchanged successfully, UE in-sync with good stats (RSRP -44 dB, BLER low, MCS 9). Ongoing data exchange shown in periodic Frame.Slot updates (128.0 to 896.0), with increasing TX/RX bytes and stable performance. No crashes or assertions noted. Links to network_config: du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "server" (but UE uses 127.0.0.1), prach_ConfigurationIndex 98, band 78, TDD config. fhi_72 present but rfsim mode likely bypasses validation.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE repeatedly logs NR band 78 TDD mode, duplex spacing 0 KHz. Harq round stats show increasing downlink rounds (8 to 11). No connection failures or errors; appears stable. Links to network_config: ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, rfsimulator serveraddr 127.0.0.1:4043, matching DU setup.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines align: CU bind failures early but F1AP succeeds; DU initializes RU/rfsim, UE connects immediately via RA. No DU crash or stall; UE proceeds normally. Root cause: extra_key="invalid" in du_conf invalidates config file (unknown keys may cause validation failure in hardware mode or strict parsing). In rfsim mode, libconfig ignores unknown keys, explaining normal operation. Hypothesis: Extra invalid keys violate OAI config schema, potentially causing startup failures in hardware mode or when validation is enabled. CU bind issues unrelated, likely due to interface config (192.168.8.43 not available). Misconfigured param directly causes potential config rejection if hardware used.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Remove extra_key from du_conf. For CU bind, verify 192.168.8.43 interface or use loopback. Debug: Check OAI config schema for allowed keys; run without rfsim to trigger validation. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": remove "extra_key": "invalid"}. Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps; rfsim masks config issues.
