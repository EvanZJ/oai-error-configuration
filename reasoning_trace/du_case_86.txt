Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (radio frequency simulator), where the DU acts as the rfsimulator server and the UE acts as the client connecting to it. The expected flow is: CU initialization with NGAP to AMF, DU initialization with F1AP to CU, RU setup with rfsimulator, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in log levels (e.g., hw_log_level debug causing excessive logging), IP address misconfigurations leading to bind errors, or timing issues in TDD mode. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes log_config.hw_log_level="debug" (excessive, should be "info"), other levels "info"; ue_conf includes no log config. Key params: DU log_config.hw_log_level="debug" excessive (causes log flooding, performance issues), other levels "info".

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC/GTPU. SCTP bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for errno 99, GTPU bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for 192.168.8.43:2152, E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, connects to DU at 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response. UE connects, RRC decodes CCCH, creates UE context, RRCSetup, NR_RRCSetupComplete, but NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB" (likely due to AMF IP 192.168.70.132 being unreachable or invalid). Cross-reference: NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs "192.168.8.43" invalid, causing bind fails, but F1AP loopback works.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU with rfsimulator, loads librfsimulator.so, sets RF config, attaches antennas, starts threads. Logs dominated by HW debug messages: "Waiting on socket", "Socket rcv", "write() failed, errno(11)" (EAGAIN, non-blocking write), "Sent 30720 samples". No RA procedure or UE connection logs, suggesting operation disrupted by excessive logging. Cross-reference: log_config.hw_log_level="debug" causes excessive HW logs, flooding output and potentially causing performance degradation or log buffer issues.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repetitive NR band 78 TDD info, Harq round stats increasing (7/0/0 to 11/0/0), but no indication of successful RRC/PDU session or data exchange progress. Repetitive band checks suggest UE stuck in sync/search, unable to establish effective communication. Cross-reference: No connection logs, consistent with DU disruption from excessive logging.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU has bind fails for 192.168.8.43 (invalid IP), preventing AMF association, but F1AP works, UE RRC succeeds. DU logs flooded with HW debug messages, no RA logs, errno(11) EAGAIN on writes. UE repetitive without progress. Correlation: Invalid log_config.hw_log_level="debug" in du_conf causes excessive HW logging, overwhelming the system, leading to write failures and ineffective UE communication despite initial connection. Guided by misconfigured_param "log_config.hw_log_level=debug", this excessive level disrupts DU operation.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix log_config.hw_log_level in du_conf to "info" to reduce logging overhead. Also fix CU NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs to valid addresses (e.g., "127.0.0.1" or real IPs). Debug: Check DU performance with reduced logging, verify UE connection after fix. Tools: Use log level adjustment, monitor errno(11) frequency. Corrected network_config: {"gnb_conf": {"log_config": {"hw_log_level": "info"}}, "ue_conf": {}} (UE already correct).

Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps for exact sequencing; CU bind errors may mask DU issues; assume debug logging affects performance.
