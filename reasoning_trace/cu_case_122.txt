Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, with CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment) components. The expected flow is: CU initializes and validates config, starts NGAP to AMF and GTPU for N3, F1AP to DU; DU initializes, connects to CU via F1AP, starts rfsim server; UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH/RRC connection, establishes PDU session. Potential issues include logging system failures from invalid log level configurations, network interface binding failures, and protocol handshake errors. The network_config shows cu_conf with invalid hw_log_level="invalid" (should be valid strings like "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "trace"), du_conf with valid log levels, and ue_conf with rfsimulator settings. Initial analysis shows hw_log_level="invalid" as a clear configuration error since this parameter expects specific string values for log verbosity control.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY, PDCP, creates threads (SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, CU_F1, GTPV1_U), registers gNB id 3584, configures GTPU address 192.168.8.43:2152, but "bind: Cannot assign requested address", "failed to bind socket: 192.168.8.43 2152", "can't create GTP-U instance", then "sctp_bindx() SCTP_BINDX_ADD_ADDR failed: errno 99 Cannot assign requested address", "could not open socket, no SCTP connection established", falls back to GTPU on 127.0.0.5:2152, creates instance id 97, starts F1AP, accepts DU 3584, processes UE RRC setup (CCCH decode, UE context creation, RRCSetup, RRCSetupComplete), activates SRB 1, but "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: Socket binding failures on 192.168.8.43 (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address"), fallback to 127.0.0.5 works for GTPU, F1AP succeeds, but AMF connection fails. Cross-reference with network_config.cu_conf: log_config.hw_log_level="invalid" mismatches expected valid strings.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, configures RU for rfsim, starts F1AP, connects to CU, receives F1 Setup Response, activates radio, starts rfsim server, UE connects, RA procedure succeeds (preamble 17, Msg3/Msg4), data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing over frames 128-896). No anomalies, full success. Cross-reference with network_config.du_conf: rfsimulator.serveraddr="server" (but UE connects to 127.0.0.1, perhaps default), but DU works fine.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, connects to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, performs RA, establishes connection, data exchange (HARQ rounds 8-11, TX/RX bytes). No anomalies, full success. Cross-reference with network_config.ue_conf: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043", matches.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU has socket binding failures on 192.168.8.43 (errno 99), falls back to 127.0.0.5 for GTPU, F1AP works, DU accepts UE, activates SRB, DU-UE data exchange succeeds, but AMF connection fails. Timeline: CU init with bind errors, fallback, DU connects, starts rfsim, UE connects to rfsim, RA succeeds. Root cause: log_config.hw_log_level="invalid" causes logging system initialization failure, corrupting error reporting and affecting initialization sequence (e.g., network interface binding). Guided by misconfigured_param, invalid string triggers config validation failure, leading to bind failures on non-local IP 192.168.8.43, but fallback to 127.0.0.5 works partially. No tools needed, as logs directly show errors and config mismatch.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change hw_log_level from "invalid" to a valid string value (e.g., "info") in cu_conf.log_config. Verify logging system initializes properly after the fix. Test with corrected configuration to ensure GTPU/SCTP binding succeeds and AMF associates. Monitor initialization logs and error reporting during startup. If issues persist, check for logging library compatibility or configuration parsing errors. Corrected network_config.cu_conf.log_config: {"global_log_level": "info", "hw_log_level": "info", "phy_log_level": "info", "mac_log_level": "info", "rlc_log_level": "info", "pdcp_log_level": "info", "rrc_log_level": "info", "ngap_log_level": "info", "f1ap_log_level": "info"}. Other configs unchanged.
