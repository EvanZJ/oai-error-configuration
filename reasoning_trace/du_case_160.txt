Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for radio simulation, as indicated by DU logs showing rfsim config and UE command line with rfsim options. The expected flow is CU init with NGAP/AMF setup, DU init with RU/rfsim server, F1AP connection, UE PRACH/RRC connection. However, the misconfigured parameter "gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].prach_msg1_FDM=8" suggests invalid PRACH msg1 FDM value. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes servingCellConfigCommon with prach_msg1_FDM=8 (invalid, as per OAI assertion valid 0-3), prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, pMax=20, ssPBCH_BlockPower=-25, SCTP streams=2, MACRLCs/L1s num_cc=1, RUs nb_tx=4, rfsimulator serveraddr="server", fhi_72 present but system_core=0 (valid). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". cu_conf has AMF IP 192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43". Potential issues: Invalid prach_msg1_FDM=8 causes DU assertion failure during config_common(), crashing DU before rfsim server starts, leading to UE connect failures; CU has network binds but proceeds.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, creates threads, sets up GTPU on 192.168.8.43:2152 but bind fails "Cannot assign requested address", SCTP bind fails errno 99, E1AP fails CUUP listener, NGAP registers gNB but no AMF association. F1AP starts, receives DU setup request, sends response, processes UE RRCSetupComplete. Network binds fail (possibly due to IP not configured), but CU waits for DU which crashes.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts init, configures L1/MAC, reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78), sets carrier config, but in config_common() at line 411: "Assertion (1 == 0) failed! msg1 FDM identifier 8 undefined (0,1,2,3)". DU exits immediately due to invalid prach_msg1_FDM=8. No RU init or rfsim server startup.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes threads, loads rfsimulator device, attempts connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails errno(111) "Connection refused", as rfsim server never starts due to DU crash. UE loops connect attempts indefinitely.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crashes on invalid prach_msg1_FDM=8 during config_common(), preventing RU/rfsim init and F1AP completion. CU initializes but bind failures (192.168.8.43 not available) and no DU connection. UE can't connect to rfsim server. The misconfigured "gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].prach_msg1_FDM=8" is invalid (OAI code asserts valid 0-3, corresponding to 1,2,4,8 PRACH occasions per 3GPP TS 38.211). Hypothesis: prach_msg1_FDM=8 triggers assertion in config.c:538, crashing DU → no rfsim server → UE connect fails. CU proceeds but AMF association fails due to network issues. External knowledge: OAI config.c AssertFatal checks rach_ConfigGeneric.msg1_FDM in 0-3; examples use 0.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Set prach_msg1_FDM to 0 (valid for 1 occasion, common in configs). If 8 occasions needed, set to 3. Ensure 192.168.8.43 interface configured. Debug: Check OAI logs for assertion details. Corrected network_config:
