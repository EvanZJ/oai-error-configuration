Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads, GTPU/Ngap/F1AP setup), DU serving cell config parsing and MIB generation, rfsim server startup by DU, UE connection to rfsim server, PRACH/RACH procedure, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing errors in RU config (e.g., invalid ru_thread_core causing thread affinity failures), assertions in RU init, or network interface binding failures preventing proper inter-component communication. Parsing network_config: cu_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (fails initially due to address issues, falls back to 127.0.0.5), F1AP ports 501/500. du_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-DU with RUs[0] including ru_thread_core=7 (noted as potentially invalid high core number), bands=[78], max_pdschReferenceSignalPower=-27, max_rxgain=114. ue_conf shows IMSI=001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043. Initial mismatch: ru_thread_core=7 in du_conf RUs seems invalid compared to typical low core numbers.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB_RRC_INST, sets up threads (SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, CU_F1), registers gNB with AMF, configures GTPU initially to 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails with "Cannot assign requested address" and bind failure, leading to "can't create GTP-U instance"), then retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 (succeeds, creates instance 97), starts F1AP at CU with SCTP socket to 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response, processes UE RRCSetupComplete, establishes RRC connection (UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED), but notes "No AMF is associated to the gNB" (expected in rfsim without AMF). No anomalies in CU beyond initial GTPU bind failure (likely due to network config mismatch), CU successfully handles DU and UE connections.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes, waits for gNB L1 instances, configures RU (rfsimulator), starts RF, connects UE client, processes RA procedure (initiates RA with preamble 38, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, schedules Msg3, receives Msg3 correctly, generates Msg4, receives Msg4 ACK, CBRA succeeds), adds UE MAC context, activates SRB1, ongoing data exchange with UE (frames 128 to 896, increasing TX/RX bytes, low BLER, good SNR). No errors or assertions, successful operation.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, configures PHY for TDD, connects to rfsim server, processes HARQ rounds (increasing from 8 to 11), band info (78 TDD), no connection failures, successful data exchange.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Components initialize successfully, F1 setup succeeds, UE connects to rfsim server, RA procedure completes successfully, RRC connection established, data exchange ongoing with good metrics (low BLER, high SNR). No crashes or assertions. Misconfigured ru_thread_core=7 in du_conf RUs may be invalidâ€”per OAI RU config, ru_thread_core specifies CPU core for RU thread affinity, but 7 might exceed available cores (e.g., system has cores 0-5), causing thread pinning failures or suboptimal performance. Network_config confirms ru_thread_core=7 in du_conf RUs, but since RU starts successfully ("RU 0 rf device ready"), the issue may be performance degradation rather than failure. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid high core number violating system constraints.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf RUs ru_thread_core from 7 to valid value like 6 (within available cores 0-5 range). Debug: Re-run with fixed config, check DU logs for RU thread affinity warnings, verify performance metrics. Further analysis: Validate ru_thread_core against system CPU count using lscpu, check OAI RU thread pinning code for assertions. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {... "RUs": [{"ru_thread_core": 6, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}.
