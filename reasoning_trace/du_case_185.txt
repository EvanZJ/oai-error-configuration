Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with monolithic mode (CU/DU combined). The expected flow is: component initialization (PHY/MAC/RRC threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, rfsim server startup for UE connection, PRACH/RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid BWP bandwidth values causing PUCCH resource allocation failures), GTPU binding errors (address conflicts), or rfsim server crashes after UE connection. Network_config shows gnb_conf (du_conf) with servingCellConfigCommon having dl_frequencyBand=78 (valid), physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 (invalid, causes BWP size=1 insufficient for PUCCH), dl_carrierBandwidth=106, ul_frequencyBand=78. Ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatch: initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 violates BWP bandwidth requirements, likely causing PUCCH allocation assert after UE RA.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, creates threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. Registers gNB[0] with macro id 3584, checks AMF registration. GTPU configures SA mode but fails to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 (address not assignable), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 and succeeds (instance id 97). F1AP starts at CU, receives F1 Setup Request from DU 3584, accepts and sends F1 Setup Response. No anomalies in CU init beyond GTPU address issues, which don't prevent F1AP. CU establishes connection with DU.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, configures RUs, starts rfsim server, waits for sync. All RUs ready, gNBs ready, sends sync to threads. RU 0 RF started, generates void samples. Receives UE connection, sends time. Processes RA procedure: initiates RA with preamble 25, activates RA process, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, schedules Msg3. Receives PUSCH with TC-RNTI correctly, adds UE MAC context. Then hits assertion: "Assertion (pucchres0->startingPRB < curr_bwp) failed! In config_pucch_resset0() ... Not enough resources in current BWP (size 1) to allocate uid 0". This crashes DU in nr_rrc_config.c:960 during PUCCH resource set 0 config. Config shows parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 1, nb_ru 1. Crash occurs after UE RA Msg3 reception.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, configures 8 cards/channels for TDD, creates threads. Loads RFSIMULATOR device, connects to 127.0.0.1:4043 successfully after retries. Decodes SSB, syncs with PCI 0, adjusts frequency offset. Decodes SIB1, initializes RA procedure, selects RO, transmits PRACH. Receives BI RAR, then RAR with RAPID 25, transmits RA-Msg3. Connection established but lost socket after Msg3 transmission.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU starts successfully, F1AP connects to CU, rfsim server runs, UE connects and completes initial sync/SIB1 decode/RA initiation. DU processes RA Msg2/Msg3 successfully until PUCCH config. Misconfigured initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 triggers assertion in config_pucch_resset0() (nr_rrc_config.c:960), as BWP size=1 (from locationAndBandwidth=0) insufficient for PUCCH resource allocation (startingPRB >= curr_bwp). Valid range requires BWP bandwidth >1 PRB for PUCCH. This invalid BWP size causes immediate DU exit during UE context setup after RA. CU detects SCTP shutdown, releases DU. UE loses connection. Hypothesis: initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth=0 violates BWP bandwidth constraints, leading to PUCCH allocation assert. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid BWP config.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth to valid value (e.g., 28875 for sufficient BWP bandwidth). Debug by checking nr_rrc_config.c config_pucch_resset0() for BWP size validation. Run with corrected config, verify DU handles UE RA without PUCCH assert. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": { ... (unchanged) },
  "du_conf": {
    ... (unchanged except servingCellConfigCommon[0].initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth: 28875)
  },
  "ue_conf": { ... (unchanged) }
}
Explanation: Changed initialDLBWPlocationAndBandwidth from 0 to 28875 (valid BWP config ensuring bandwidth >1 PRB for PUCCH resources per TS 38.331).
