Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This case involves an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim (radio frequency simulator) for testing CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment) components. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU loads config, starts threads for NGAP, GTPU, F1AP; DU initializes PHY/MAC with rfsim RU; UE connects to rfsim server), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP association with AMF, UE random access (PRACH) and RRC connection, followed by PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include config validation failures (e.g., invalid thread counts causing init errors), socket binding failures (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address" for non-local IPs like 192.168.8.43), AMF association failures ("No AMF is associated"), or UE connection stalls. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Num_Threads_PUSCH=-1 (invalid negative value, likely should be >=0), gNBs with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43 (mismatch with AMF IP, but AMF IP is for remote AMF, NETWORK_INTERFACES for local gNB IPs). du_conf has standard params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (but UE has "127.0.0.1", potential mismatch). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1", imsi=001010000000101. Initial mismatches: Num_Threads_PUSCH=-1 is invalid; AMF IP 192.168.70.132 vs local NG_AMF IP 192.168.8.43 (local should match AMF IP for NGAP binding); rfsim serveraddr "server" in DU vs "127.0.0.1" in UE.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY structures, creates gNB_RRC_INST, sets F1AP IDs, disables SDAP/X2AP, enables PDCP GTPU. Threads created: TASK_SCTP (fails SCTP_BINDX_ADD_ADDR errno 99 for 192.168.8.43, no SCTP connection), TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB. GTPU configures for 192.168.8.43:2152, bind fails errno 99, can't create GTP-U instance (id=-1), E1AP fails CUUP N3 UDP listener. Falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 for GTPU (id=97). F1AP starts at CU, TASK_CU_F1 created, RRC enters main loop, accepts DU F1 Setup Request from gNB-Eurecom-DU (assoc_id 287), sends F1 Setup Response, DU uses RRC v17.3.0. Decodes CCCH RNTI c95d, creates UE context CU UE ID 1 DU UE ID 51549, activates SRB1, generates RRCSetup for c95d, processes NR_RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. But "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: SCTP/GTPU bind failures for 192.168.8.43 (likely IP not assigned to interface), fallback to loopback works for F1AP/GTPU, but NGAP AMF association fails despite NGAP thread running. No explicit config load errors, but Num_Threads_PUSCH=-1 might cause silent failures in thread pool init, affecting NGAP/AMF logic.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU waits for gNB L1 instances, configures RU with rfsim librfsimulator.so, sets band 78 SCS 1, half-slot parallelization 1, RU rf device ready. Initializes random seed, frame_parms, sync threads. Loads libs: libdfts.so, libldpc.so. Sends sync, all RUs ready, init gNBs. Command line for UE: -C 3619200000 -r 106 --numerology 1 --ssb 516. Client connects, sends time. RA procedure initiated preamble 32, energy 54dB, TC-RNTI c95d, Msg2 DCI RA RNTI 0x10b, Msg3 scheduled, RA Contention Resolution timer 64ms. PUSCH received correctly, adds UE MAC context c95d, Msg3 received, activates SRB0/SRB1, generates Msg4, UE acknowledges, RA succeeds. UE in-sync, stats show increasing TX/RX bytes, BLER decreasing, SNR stable ~51-57dB. No crashes or assertions; DU runs continuously with UE connected. Crash points: None; init successful, RA completes, UE stats normal.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs show repeated NR band 78 TDD mode, duplex spacing 0KHz. Harq round stats for Downlink: 8/0/0 to 11/0/0 (increasing rounds, no errors). No connection failures or retries; seems stuck in a loop printing band info and stats. No explicit connect attempts to rfsim server; assumes already connected via RA in DU logs. Links to ue_conf: rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1" (matches DU fallback? DU has "server", but UE connects via RA over F1AP). Frequency implied by -C 3619200000 (3.6GHz band 78).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines: CU init ~lines 1-20, SCTP/GTPU bind fails ~lines 21-30, fallback to 127.0.0.5 ~lines 31-40, F1AP start ~line 41, DU F1 Setup ~line 42, UE RA ~DU lines 50-70, UE connected ~CU line 43, but AMF not associated ~CU last line. DU starts after CU F1AP, UE connects via DU RA, but no AMF means no NGAP/PDU session. Correlation: Bind failures for 192.168.8.43 (non-local IP) cause GTPU failure, but fallback works; SCTP failure might prevent AMF association. Hypothesis: Num_Threads_PUSCH=-1 invalid value causes config validation failure or runtime thread pool init error in CU, corrupting NGAP/AMF association logic (e.g., NGAP thread fails to bind or register AMF). Guided by misconfigured_param: Negative thread count invalid per OAI code (likely asserts or defaults to 0, but -1 causes issues). Impacts: AMF association fails despite NGAP thread, UE connects but no PDU session. If uncertain on OAI thread validation, use tool: search "OpenAirInterface Num_Threads_PUSCH validation" or "OAI PUSCH thread configuration". But based on advance knowledge, invalid negative values cause init failures in thread creation.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set Num_Threads_PUSCH to valid positive integer (e.g., 1) in cu_conf; ensure NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF matches available interface (e.g., change to 127.0.0.1 for local testing); align rfsim serveraddr in du_conf to "127.0.0.1" matching ue_conf. Debug: Check OAI code for Num_Threads_PUSCH usage (e.g., grep in openairinterface5g for PUSCH threads); run with --verbose to log thread creation; use strace on CU for bind calls. Tools: Use fetch_webpage for OAI docs on thread config. Corrected config snippets:
