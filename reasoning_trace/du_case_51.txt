Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: The scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) mode setup with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for testing, utilizing a centralized unit (CU) and distributed unit (DU) split architecture connected via F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) for control plane and NG Application Protocol (NGAP) for core network interface. The expected flow includes component initialization (PHY, MAC, RRC layers), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE attachment via Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) and Random Access (RA) procedure, RRC connection establishment, and PDU session setup. Potential issues to look for include configuration mismatches in SSB parameters (e.g., invalid ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap values disrupting synchronization), assertions or encoding failures in RRC configuration cloning, GTP-U binding failures due to IP address issues, or AMF association problems preventing NGAP connectivity. Parsing the network_config JSON: The gnb_conf (DU config) includes servingCellConfigCommon with ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap set to 0, which is atypical as this parameter represents the bitmap of SSB positions in the burst and should be non-zero (e.g., 1 for position 0); other params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ra_ResponseWindow=4 appear valid. The ue_conf specifies rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043" for simulation, with IMSI "001010000000101" and NSSAI SST=1.

Analyzing CU Logs: The CU initializes in monolithic mode with NFAPI, creates threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, and GTPU. It registers gNB[0] with ID 3584, checks AMF state, configures GTPU for SA mode with address 192.168.8.43:2152 but encounters a bind failure ("Cannot assign requested address"), then switches to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. SCTP bind fails for F1AP ("could not open socket"), but recovers, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, accepts it, sends F1 Setup Response. Anomalies include initial GTPU/SCTP bind failures (possibly due to unavailable IPs), but F1AP succeeds; no UE connection logged, suggesting issue downstream.

Analyzing DU Logs: The DU initializes with NFAPI, sets up L1, MAC, RRC, configures RU with rfsim, loads libraries, initializes gNBs, sends sync, starts ITTI handler. It runs as rfsim server, waits for clients, shows frame slots advancing (128.0 to 896.0), but no UE RA or connection events. Cross-referencing with network_config's du_conf: Params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ra_ResponseWindow=4, ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap=0 are present, but ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap=0 is invalid.

Analyzing UE Logs: The UE repeatedly attempts initial sync detection, cell search with center freq 3619200000 Hz, bandwidth 106, scanning GSCN 0 with SSB offset 516, but notes "SSB position provided" and continues scanning without success. No sync achieved or connection attempts. Cross-referencing with network_config's ue_conf: The rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043" match DU's rfsimulator config, but UE fails to connect/sync.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Correlating timelines: DU initializes successfully, runs rfsim server, advances frames, but no UE sync; CU establishes F1AP but no UE context created; UE repeatedly scans for SSB but fails. Guided by the misconfigured_param, ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap=0 is invalid as SSB-PositionsInBurst is a bitmap indicating used SSB positions per 3GPP TS 38.331; value 0 means no SSB positions, preventing SSB transmission and UE sync. Hypothesis: Invalid ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap=0 causes no SSB to be transmitted, halting UE synchronization and connection. Using external knowledge: Per 3GPP TS 38.211 and TS 38.331, at least one SSB position must be set; 0 disables all, causing UE to fail cell search.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap from 0 to 1 (enable SSB at position 0). Debug steps: Check SSB config in OAI; verify bitmap values against 3GPP specs; run UE sync logs. Tools: Use spectrum analyzer for SSB presence; grep OAI code for ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap. Corrected network_config JSON snippet: {"cu_conf": {...}, "du_conf": {"Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], "gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap": 1, ...}]}]}, "ue_conf": {...}}.

Limitations: Logs show DU running but no UE sync; truncated logs miss full error traces; assumes ssb_PositionsInBurst_Bitmap=0 causes sync failure based on param.
