Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim, using CU-DU split architecture. The expected flow is: CU initializes threads (NGAP, GTPU, F1AP), binds to local addresses for SCTP and GTPU; DU initializes, connects to CU via F1AP/SCTP; F1 setup succeeds; DU starts rfsim server; UE connects to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043 for simulation. Potential issues include config mismatches in network interfaces (e.g., invalid local_s_address causing bind failures), asserts in code, connection failures. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has gNBs.local_s_address="" (empty), remote_s_address="127.0.0.3", local_s_portc=501, remote_s_portc=500; du_conf has local_n_address="127.0.0.3", remote_n_address="127.0.0.5"; ue_conf has rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: empty local_s_address in cu_conf vs. expected valid IP for SCTP/GTPU binds, guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.local_s_address=".

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes structures, sets gNB=0x5db0c3afca20, no prs_config, nb_nr_L1_inst:0. Allocates gNB_RRC_INST, F1AP gNB_CU_id[0]=3584, gNB_CU_name="gNB-Eurecom-CU", SDAP disabled, DRB count=1, do_SIB23_NR size=9, pdcp init with GTPU, default drx=0, gNB_app_register. Creates threads: TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP (gNB[0] registered, macro gNB id=3584, checks AMF state), TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1. GTPU configuring SA mode, address=192.168.8.43 port=2152, initializes UDP, bind fails "Cannot assign requested address", can't create GTP-U instance, id=-1. E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starting at CU, creates TASK_GTPV1_U, F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ len=1. GTPU initializes UDP for "" (empty address) port=2152, getaddrinfo error "Name or service not known", can't create GTP-U instance. Assertion (status == 0) failed in sctp_create_new_listener errno=99 "Name or service not known". Assertion (getCxt(instance)->gtpInst > 0) failed in F1AP_CU_task:133 "Failed to create CU F1-U UDP listener". Exits. Anomalies: Bind failures for both GTPU addresses (192.168.8.43 and empty), SCTP bindx failed errno=99, assertions causing exit. Cross-reference: local_s_address empty in cu_conf matches empty address in GTPU init, causing getaddrinfo fail.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts with ngran_DU TDD config for cell 0, cmdline --rfsim --sa -O du_gnb.conf. Initializes northbound for L1, DL/UL freq=3619200000 band=48, configures F1 for MACRLC, MeasurementTimingConfiguration. Creates gNB_tasks nb_nr_L1_inst:1, l1_north_init_gNB, callbacks for UL_indication, allocates gNB_RRC_INST, SDAP disabled, DRB=1, no ciphering/integrity defaults. Creates threads: TASK_SCTP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_GTPV1_U, TASK_DU_F1. PHY init gNB 0, registers with MAC, sets indication lists, gNB structure allocated. F1AP starting at DU, F1-C DU IPaddr=127.0.0.3 connect to CU=127.0.0.5 binding GTP=127.0.0.3, GTPU init UDP 127.0.0.3:2152 id=98. SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused, F1AP retrying. Repeated Connection refused, waiting for F1 Setup Response before radio activation. No crash, but stalled waiting for CU. Link to network_config: du_conf local_n_address=127.0.0.3 remote=127.0.0.5 matches F1AP config.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY for gNB TXant=1 RXant=1, no prs_config, freq=3619200000, Nsymb=28, N_TA_offset=800. Configures HW cards 0-7 for TDD, freq=3619200000, gain tx=0 rx=110. Initializes UE threads: UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE. HW running as client, loads RFSIMULATOR, tries connect to 127.0.0.1:4043, fails errno(111) Connection refused. Repeated fails. UICC IMSI=001010000000101, etc. Link to ue_conf: rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1 port=4043 matches attempts.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU exits early due to bind failures and assertions, preventing F1AP server start. DU retries SCTP connect to CU (127.0.0.5) but gets refused, stalls waiting for F1 setup, never starts rfsim server. UE fails to connect to rfsim at 127.0.0.1:4043 since server not running. Timeline: CU init fails immediately, DU waits indefinitely, UE retries indefinitely. Misconfigured_param "gNBs.local_s_address=" (empty) causes GTPU/SCTP binds to fail (errno=99 for invalid address), assertions trigger exit. Hypothesis: Empty local_s_address invalidates address resolution, preventing CU from binding to interfaces, halting F1 setup. No tools needed, as misconfig clear from logs/config mismatch.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set gNBs.local_s_address to valid IP, e.g., "127.0.0.5" to match remote_s_address in du_conf. Debug: Check ifconfig for available interfaces, use netstat to verify binds. Tools: strace for bind calls, tcpdump for SCTP packets. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "local_s_address": "127.0.0.5"
    }
  },
  "du_conf": {},
  "ue_conf": {}
}
Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps, JSON complete.
