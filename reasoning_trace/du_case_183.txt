Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with monolithic mode (CU/DU combined). The expected flow is: component initialization (PHY/MAC/RRC threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, rfsim server startup for UE connection, PRACH/RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid NR-ARFCN values causing assertions in nr_common.c), GTPU binding errors (address conflicts), or rfsim server not starting due to DU crashes. Network_config shows gnb_conf (du_conf) with servingCellConfigCommon having dl_frequencyBand=78 (valid), physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=0 (invalid, must be >=620000 for band 78 per TS 38.104), dl_carrierBandwidth=106, ul_frequencyBand=78. Ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatch: dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=0 violates NR-ARFCN range for band 78, likely causing DU crash before rfsim server starts.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, creates threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. Registers gNB[0] with macro id 3584, checks AMF registration. GTPU configures SA mode but fails to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 (address not assignable), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 and succeeds (instance id 97). F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5. SCTP bindx fails initially but proceeds. No anomalies in CU init beyond GTPU address issues, which don't prevent F1AP. CU waits for DU connection, no AMF connection shown yet.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes with monolithic mode, creates gNB tasks, sets antenna ports (pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 2, pusch_AntennaPorts 4), minTXRXTIME 6, SIB1 TDA 15, MIMO layers 1. Reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78, ABSFREQPOINTA 0, DLBW 106, RACH_TargetReceivedPower -96). Processes band 78 (TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz), converts SSB to 3619200000 Hz. Configures MAC common params, DL_Bandwidth:40. Then hits assertion: "Assertion (nrarfcn >= N_OFFs) failed! In from_nrarfcn() ... nrarfcn 0 < N_OFFs[78] 620000". This crashes DU in nr_common.c:606 during NR-ARFCN validation. Config shows parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 1, nb_ru 1. Crash prevents rfsim server startup.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, sets TX/RX freq 3619200000 Hz, configures 8 cards/channels for TDD, creates threads (UEthread/L1_UE_stats/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE). Loads RFSIMULATOR device, tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly (errno 111 - connection refused). No successful connections, as rfsim server isn't running due to DU crash. UICC sim with IMSI=001010000000101, DNN=oai.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crash at NR-ARFCN validation prevents F1AP connection to CU (CU shows no DU acceptance), stopping rfsim server startup, causing UE connect failures. Misconfigured dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=0 triggers assertion in from_nrarfcn() (nr_common.c:606), as NR-ARFCN must be >= N_OFFs[78]=620000 per TS 38.104. Valid range for band 78 is 620000-653333. This invalid ARFCN causes immediate DU exit during ServingCellConfigCommon parsing, before PHY init completes. CU proceeds but stalls without DU. UE can't connect as server isn't listening. Hypothesis: dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=0 violates spec/OAI validation, leading to assert in NR-ARFCN conversion. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid ARFCN.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA to valid NR-ARFCN for band 78 (e.g., 640008 to align with SSB raster). Debug by checking nr_common.c from_nrarfcn() for ARFCN validation. Run with corrected config, verify DU starts rfsim server, UE connects. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": { ... (unchanged) },
  "du_conf": {
    ... (unchanged except servingCellConfigCommon[0].dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA: 640008)
  },
  "ue_conf": { ... (unchanged) }
}
Explanation: Changed dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA from 0 to 640008 (valid NR-ARFCN for band 78, ensuring SSB raster compatibility per TS 38.104).
