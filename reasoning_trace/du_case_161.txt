Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for radio simulation, as indicated by DU logs showing rfsim config and UE command line with rfsim options. The expected flow is CU init with NGAP/AMF setup, DU init with RU/rfsim server, F1AP connection, UE PRACH/RRC connection. However, the misconfigured parameter "gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].ra_ResponseWindow=16" suggests invalid RA response window value. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes servingCellConfigCommon with ra_ResponseWindow=16 (invalid, as per 3GPP TS 38.331 enumerated values 1,2,4,8,10,14,20,28,32,40,48,56,64), prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, pMax=20, ssPBCH_BlockPower=-25, SCTP streams=2, MACRLCs/L1s num_cc=1, RUs nb_tx=4, rfsimulator serveraddr="server", fhi_72 present but system_core=0 (valid). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". cu_conf has AMF IP 192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43". Potential issues: Invalid ra_ResponseWindow=16 causes ASN.1 encoding failure in RRC config, crashing DU before rfsim server starts, leading to UE connect failures.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, creates threads, sets up GTPU on 192.168.8.43:2152 but bind fails "Cannot assign requested address", SCTP bind fails errno 99, E1AP fails CUUP listener, NGAP registers gNB but no AMF association. F1AP starts but no DU connection received. Network binds fail (possibly due to IP not configured), CU waits for DU.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts init, configures L1/MAC, reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78), sets carrier config, TDD period 6, MIB config, but in clone_rach_configcommon() at line 68: "Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed! could not clone NR_RACH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding". DU exits immediately due to ASN.1 encoding failure from invalid ra_ResponseWindow=16.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes threads, loads rfsimulator device, attempts connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails errno(111) "Connection refused", as rfsim server never starts due to DU crash. UE loops connect attempts indefinitely.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crashes on ASN.1 encoding failure in clone_rach_configcommon() from invalid ra_ResponseWindow=16 during RRC config cloning. CU initializes but bind failures (192.168.8.43 not available) and no DU connection. UE can't connect to rfsim server. The misconfigured "gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].ra_ResponseWindow=16" is invalid (TS 38.331 ra-ResponseWindow enumerated 1,2,4,8,10,14,20,28,32,40,48,56,64). Hypothesis: ra_ResponseWindow=16 triggers ASN.1 encoding failure in nr_rrc_config.c:68, crashing DU → no rfsim server → UE connect fails. CU proceeds but AMF association fails due to network issues. External knowledge: OAI RRC config cloning fails on invalid enumerated values; TS 38.331 defines ra-ResponseWindow as enumerated.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Set ra_ResponseWindow to 4 (valid value for 4 slots). If different window needed, choose from valid list. Ensure 192.168.8.43 interface configured. Debug: Check ASN.1 encoding logs. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": { ... (unchanged) },
  "du_conf": {
    ... (unchanged except servingCellConfigCommon[0].ra_ResponseWindow: 4)
    "servingCellConfigCommon": [
      {
        ... (unchanged except ra_ResponseWindow: 4)
        "ra_ResponseWindow": 4,
        ...
      }
    ]
  },
  "ue_conf": { ... (unchanged) }
}
