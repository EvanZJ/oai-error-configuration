Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (radio frequency simulator), where the DU acts as the rfsimulator server and the UE acts as the client connecting to it. The expected flow is: CU initialization with NGAP to AMF, DU initialization with F1AP to CU, RU setup with rfsimulator, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in rfsimulator parameters (e.g., serverport invalid causing bind failures), IP address misconfigurations leading to bind errors, or timing issues in TDD mode. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="server" (default), serverport=0 (invalid, should be 4043), modelname="AWGN"; ue_conf includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043", modelname="AWGN". Key params: DU rfsimulator serverport=0 invalid (port 0 means random assignment, client can't connect), UE serverport="4043" matches default.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC/GTPU. SCTP bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for errno 99, GTPU bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for 192.168.8.43:2152, E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, connects to DU at 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response. No UE connection logs in CU. Cross-reference: NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs "192.168.8.43" invalid, causing bind fails, but F1AP loopback works.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU with rfsimulator, loads librfsimulator.so, "Running as server waiting opposite rfsimulators to connect", sets RF config, attaches antennas, starts threads. "RU 0 RF started opp_enabled 0", "No connected device, generating void samples..." (indicates rfsim server running but no client connected). No UE RA or connection logs. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serverport=0 invalid, server binds to random port, UE can't connect.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes threads, loads RFSIMULATOR device, "Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side". Repeatedly tries "Trying to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043", but "connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)" (ECONNREFUSED, connection refused). No sync or connection progress. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serverport="4043" correct, but DU server not listening on 4043 due to port=0.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU has bind fails for 192.168.8.43 (invalid IP), preventing AMF association, but F1AP works. DU initializes rfsim server but "No connected device" indicates no client connection. UE repeatedly fails to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 with ECONNREFUSED. Correlation: Invalid rfsimulator.serverport=0 in du_conf causes DU server to bind to random port (OS-assigned), UE client expects port 4043, leading to connection refusal. Guided by misconfigured_param "rfsimulator.serverport=0", this invalid port disrupts rfsim mode operation.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix rfsimulator.serverport in du_conf to 4043 to match UE expectation. Also fix CU NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs to valid addresses (e.g., "127.0.0.1" or real IPs). Debug: Check netstat for listening ports, verify UE connects after fix. Tools: Use ss -tlnp to check ports, tcpdump for rfsim traffic. Corrected network_config: {"gnb_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"serverport": 4043}}, "ue_conf": {}} (UE already correct).

Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps for exact sequencing; CU bind errors may mask rfsim issues; assume rfsim mode based on device load.
