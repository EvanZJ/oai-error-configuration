Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation with rfsim, CU/DU split. Expected flow: DU initializes MACRLC layers with proper num_cc, establishes F1AP, starts rfsim server, UE connects. Potential issues: MACRLC config invalid (num_cc=0), causing layer initialization failures. Parsing network_config: du_conf.MACRLCs[0].num_cc=0 (invalid, must be >=1 for component carriers), L1s[0].num_cc=1 (valid), cu_conf uses 192.168.8.43 (may not be available). Initial mismatch: MACRLCs num_cc=0 vs L1s num_cc=1, potentially causing MACRLC initialization issues.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts, initializes threads, GTPU/SCTP binds fail on 192.168.8.43, but F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response. UE connects via DU, RRC setup succeeds. AMF association fails due to SCTP bind failure. Anomalies: Bind failures suggest interface not configured, but F1AP works. Cross-reference: cu_conf.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43" matches failed bind.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, configures RU/rfsim, F1AP connects to CU despite MACRLCs num_cc=0, receives F1 Setup Response. Rfsim server starts, UE connects, RA succeeds, RRC establishes, data flows. No errors from MACRLC config. Link to network_config: du_conf.MACRLCs[0].num_cc=0 may be ignored or defaulted, but invalid per OAI requirements.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs show repeated band info, Harq stats. DU logs confirm UE connects and data transfers. Link to network_config: ue_conf.rfsimulator matches DU operation.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timeline: DU starts with invalid MACRLCs num_cc=0, but F1AP/MACRLC operation succeeds (possibly defaults to L1s num_cc=1), CU establishes F1AP, UE connects successfully, data flows. CU fails AMF association due to 192.168.8.43 bind issues. Root cause: MACRLCs[0].num_cc=0 invalid per OAI (num_cc must be >=1 for component carriers), though logs show success (likely uses L1s value), configuration is wrong and can cause MACRLC failures in strict implementations. CU bind issues separate.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set du_conf.MACRLCs[0].num_cc to valid value >=1, e.g., 1 to match L1s. For CU AMF issues, ensure 192.168.8.43 interface configured. Debug: Check MACRLC initialization logs, verify num_cc >=1. Tools: Test with corrected config, monitor MACRLC setup. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"MACRLCs": [{"num_cc": 1, ...}], ...}}  # num_cc changed from 0 to 1 for valid MACRLC configuration
