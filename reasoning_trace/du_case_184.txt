Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with monolithic mode (CU/DU combined). The expected flow is: component initialization (PHY/MAC/RRC threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, rfsim server startup for UE connection, PRACH/RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid offset values causing ASN.1 encoding failures in SIB1), GTPU binding errors (address conflicts), or rfsim server not starting due to DU crashes. Network_config shows gnb_conf (du_conf) with servingCellConfigCommon having dl_frequencyBand=78 (valid), physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, dl_offstToCarrier=-1 (invalid, must be >=0 per TS 38.331), dl_carrierBandwidth=106, ul_frequencyBand=78. Ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatch: dl_offstToCarrier=-1 violates offset range, likely causing DU crash during SIB1 encoding.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, creates threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. Registers gNB[0] with macro id 3584, checks AMF registration. GTPU configures SA mode but fails to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 (address not assignable), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 and succeeds (instance id 97). F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5. SCTP bindx fails initially but proceeds. No anomalies in CU init beyond GTPU address issues, which don't prevent F1AP. CU waits for DU connection, no AMF connection shown yet.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes with monolithic mode, creates gNB tasks, sets antenna ports (pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 2, pusch_AntennaPorts 4), minTXRXTIME 6, SIB1 TDA 15, MIMO layers 1. Reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78, ABSFREQPOINTA 640008, DLBW 106, RACH_TargetReceivedPower -96). Processes band 78 (TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz), converts SSB to 3619200000 Hz. Configures MAC common params, DL_Bandwidth:40, sets TDD period to 6, configures MIB (Nid_cell 0, DL freq 3619200000, UL freq 3619200000), initializes frame params for mu 1, N_RB 106. Then hits assertion: "Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded <= max_buffer_size * 8) failed! In encode_SIB1_NR() ... ASN1 message encoding failed (scs-SpecificCarrierList, 18446744073709551615)". This crashes DU in nr_rrc_config.c:2453 during SIB1 encoding. Config shows parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 1, nb_ru 1. Crash prevents rfsim server startup.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, sets TX/RX freq 3619200000 Hz, configures 8 cards/channels for TDD, creates threads (UEthread/L1_UE_stats/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE). Loads RFSIMULATOR device, tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly (errno 111 - connection refused). No successful connections, as rfsim server isn't running due to DU crash. UICC sim with IMSI=001010000000101, DNN=oai.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crash at SIB1 encoding prevents F1AP connection to CU (CU shows no DU acceptance), stopping rfsim server startup, causing UE connect failures. Misconfigured dl_offstToCarrier=-1 triggers ASN.1 encoding failure in encode_SIB1_NR() (nr_rrc_config.c:2453), as offsetToCarrier must be >=0 per TS 38.331. Valid range is 0-2199 for SCS 15kHz. This invalid negative offset causes scs-SpecificCarrierList encoding to fail with large invalid value (18446744073709551615), leading to immediate DU exit during SIB1 generation. CU proceeds but stalls without DU. UE can't connect as server isn't listening. Hypothesis: dl_offstToCarrier=-1 violates spec/OAI validation, leading to ASN.1 encoding assert in SIB1. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid offset.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update dl_offstToCarrier to valid value (e.g., 0 for no offset). Debug by checking nr_rrc_config.c encode_SIB1_NR() for ASN.1 encoding validation. Run with corrected config, verify DU starts rfsim server, UE connects. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": { ... (unchanged) },
  "du_conf": {
    ... (unchanged except servingCellConfigCommon[0].dl_offstToCarrier: 0)
  },
  "ue_conf": { ... (unchanged) }
}
Explanation: Changed dl_offstToCarrier from -1 to 0 (valid offset >=0 per TS 38.331, ensuring SIB1 ASN.1 encoding succeeds).
