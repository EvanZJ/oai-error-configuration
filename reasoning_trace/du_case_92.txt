Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode deployment with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) enabled, featuring a CU-DU split architecture. The expected flow includes component initialization (CU and DU threads, GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup), F1AP interface establishment between CU and DU, UE connection attempts via PRACH (Physical Random Access Channel) and RAR (Random Access Response), followed by RRC (Radio Resource Control) setup, NGAP AMF association, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include configuration mismatches in PRACH parameters (e.g., invalid configuration index causing ASN.1 encoding failures), AMF connection failures (e.g., invalid IP or port), fronthaul configuration errors causing connectivity or initialization problems, or invalid MAC addresses leading to performance degradation. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (from du_conf) includes servingCellConfigCommon with prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 (valid range 0-255 per 3GPP TS 38.211), dl_frequencyBand=78 (3.5 GHz), dl_carrierBandwidth=106 (100 MHz), ul_carrierBandwidth=106, ssPBCH_BlockPower=-25 dBm, and RU parameters like ru_thread_core=6 (valid CPU core), sl_ahead=5 (timing advance), do_precoding=0 (disabled), max_pdschReferenceSignalPower=-27 dBm (within range), sf_extension=0 (no extension), clock_src="internal", local_rf="yes". fhi_72 has system_core=0 (valid), io_core=4 (valid), worker_cores=[2] (valid), ru_addr=["invalid", "e8:c7:4f:25:80:ed"] (first invalid MAC address), dpdk_devices, ru_addr, mtu=9000, fh_config with T1a/Ta4 timings. rfsimulator has serveraddr="server" (likely invalid hostname), serverport=4043 (default), modelname="AWGN", IQfile="/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs". ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1" (valid), serverport="4043". Initial mismatches: du_conf fhi_72.ru_addr[0]="invalid" matches misconfigured_param (invalid MAC address); cu_conf has GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (may not be local interface), AMF IP 192.168.70.132 (potentially unreachable).

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization proceeds normally with monolithic mode, HW version logging, OPT disabled, PHY tasks creation, RRC/PDCP/SDAP setup, F1AP CU ID/name assignment, thread creation for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU/CU_F1. GTPU attempts bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails with "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99), leading to GTPU instance failure (-1) and E1AP failure. SCTP bind also fails with errno 99. CU recovers by rebinding GTPU to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully (instance 97), F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU, assoc_id 1200), accepts it, sends F1 Setup Response with RRC version 17.3.0. RRC decodes CCCH, creates UE context (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 23634, RNTI 5c52), activates SRB1, generates RRCSetup for RNTI 5c52, processes NR_RRCSetupComplete, sets UE state to NR_RRC_CONNECTED. However, NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB", indicating AMF connection failure despite AMF IP configured as 192.168.70.132. No crashes; CU stabilizes but lacks AMF for NGAP/PDU session.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, waits for gNB L1, configures RU threads, loads rfsimulator library, sets up RU buffers, syncs threads with core IDs shown as -1 for ru_thread (e.g., "waiting for sync (ru_thread,-1/...)", indicating invalid core assignment affecting thread affinity. RF device ready, client connects (UE), RA procedure initiated at 183.19 with preamble 6, energy 54.0 dB, RA-RNTI 010b, TC-RNTI 5c52. Generates RA-Msg2 DCI, schedules Msg3 at 184.17, starts contention resolution timer. Receives Msg3 correctly, adds UE MAC context, activates Msg4 scheduling, generates Msg4 with 149 bytes payload, receives Msg4 ACK, CBRA succeeds. Periodic stats show UE in-sync (RSRP -44 dBm, PH 0 dB, PCMAX 0 dBm), increasing dlsch_rounds (up to 9), ulsch_rounds (up to 73), BLER decreasing (down to 0.00006), TX/RX bytes growing (up to 984 TX, 8376 RX). No explicit PHY/MAC errors; DU operates normally, processing UE data. Link to network_config: prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 valid, TDD config with dl_UL_TransmissionPeriodicity=6 (5ms), nrofDownlinkSlots=7.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs are flooded with repetitive MAC-level messages: "NR band 78, duplex mode TDD, duplex spacing = 0 KHz" repeated dozens of times, interspersed with Harq round stats (8/0/0 to 11/0/0). This indicates excessive verbosity at MAC log level, likely due to processing delays or loops in MAC processing, possibly from invalid fronthaul configuration affecting UE synchronization or data handling. UE connects successfully (RA, RRCSetup, data), but repetitive logging suggests resource waste or loop, correlating with DU thread sync issues.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU recovers from bind failures, establishes F1AP with DU, processes UE RRC setup successfully, but AMF association fails ("No AMF is associated"), preventing NGAP/PDU session. DU initializes with invalid core IDs (-1) in thread sync logs, handles UE RA/Msg3/Msg4, data flows (increasing rounds, low BLER), no errors. UE connects but logs flood with repetitive MAC messages, likely due to DU's invalid ru_addr[0]="invalid" causing fronthaul connectivity failures, leading to scheduling delays, excessive retries, or logging loops in UE MAC. Timeline: DU sync shows -1 cores immediately, UE PRACH at frame 183, repetitive logs start thereafter. Hypothesis: fhi_72.ru_addr[0]="invalid" invalid MAC address, causes DU fronthaul to fail proper RU communication, disrupting timing/scheduling, leading to UE MAC repetitive logging from processing issues. AMF failure separate (IP unreachable). Network_config confirms ru_addr=["invalid", "e8:c7:4f:25:80:ed"] in du_conf fhi_72, matching misconfigured_param. No tool needed, as OAI MAC addresses are standard hex format.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change fhi_72.ru_addr[0] from "invalid" to a valid MAC address (e.g., "e8:c7:4f:25:80:ed") in du_conf to ensure proper fronthaul connectivity and prevent scheduling issues. For AMF, verify IP 192.168.70.132 reachability, update to local if needed. Debug: Check fronthaul interface status; monitor DU-RU communication. Tools: grep_search for "ru_addr" in OAI code. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"fhi_72": {"ru_addr": ["e8:c7:4f:25:80:ed", "e8:c7:4f:25:80:ed"]}}} (change "invalid" to valid MAC).
