Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, as indicated by --rfsim --sa options in DU logs and UE connecting to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043. Expected flow: CU initializes GTPU/NGAP/F1AP, DU initializes PHY/MAC/RRC with SIB1 scheduling, starts rfsim server, UE connects for PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Config mismatches in DU SIB1 TDA causing scheduling overlaps with CSI-RS, asserts in schedule_nr_sib1(), DU crashes preventing connection. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU on 127.0.0.5:2152. du_conf has gNB-Eurecom-DU with sib1_tda=0 (misconfigured), other params like pdsch_AntennaPorts_XP=2. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043, imsi=001010000000101. Initial mismatch: sib1_tda=0 in du_conf, but must be >0 to avoid CSI-RS overlap per OAI SIB1 scheduling.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads for NGAP/F1AP/GTPU, registers gNB[0], F1AP starts CU side, GTPU succeeds on 127.0.0.5:2152. Key events: Receives F1 Setup Request from DU, accepts DU, sends F1 Setup Response. Anomalies: SCTP shutdown received, DU released on assoc_id 1074, indicating DU crash after setup. No direct link to misconfigured param, but CU relies on DU for SIB1 broadcast.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU/RF, starts rfsim server, RU ready, RF started, but assertion: "Assertion ((tda_info.startSymbolIndex + tda_info.nrOfSymbols) < 14) failed!" in schedule_nr_sib1(), "SIB1 TDA 0 would cause overlap with CSI-RS. Please select a different SIB1 TDA.", exiting execution. Break down: RU init successful, but SIB1 scheduling fails due to TDA overlap. Links to network_config: sib1_tda=0 invalid for SIB1 scheduling (must avoid CSI-RS overlap per OAI schedule_nr_sib1()).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes HW for TDD at 3619200000 Hz, tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail (errno(111)). Links to network_config: rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043 matches attempts; DU crash prevents server startup, causing connect fails.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines: CU F1AP setup, DU RU init/RF start, DU asserts on SIB1 scheduling, CU receives SCTP shutdown/DU release, UE connect fails. Correlation: DU crash on SIB1 TDA overlap prevents rfsim server, causing UE connect fails; CU waits for DU. Misconfigured param "gNBs[0].sib1_tda=0" causes startSymbolIndex + nrOfSymbols >=14, violating SIB1 scheduling in schedule_nr_sib1(); OAI enforces no overlap with CSI-RS.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set sib1_tda to 15 in du_conf gNBs[0], ensuring SIB1 scheduling avoids CSI-RS overlap. This allows DU to broadcast SIB1, start rfsim server, UE connects. Debug: Check OAI schedule_nr_sib1() for TDA validation; verify TS 38.331 SIB1 timing. Further: Test with corrected config, monitor SIB1 broadcast success. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... (unchanged)}, "du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"sib1_tda": 15, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {... (unchanged)}}. This fixes invalid sib1_tda causing SIB1 CSI-RS overlap assert and DU crash.
