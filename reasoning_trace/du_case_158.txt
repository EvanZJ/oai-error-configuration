Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation with rfsim, CU/DU split. Expected flow: DU initializes with proper logging, establishes F1AP, starts rfsim server, UE connects. Potential issues: Log level too restrictive (error only), suppressing debug info needed for diagnosis. Parsing network_config: du_conf.log_config.global_log_level="error" (too restrictive, should be "info" or "debug" for visibility), cu_conf uses 192.168.8.43 (may not be available). Initial mismatch: global_log_level="error" limits log output, potentially hiding issues.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts, initializes threads, GTPU/SCTP binds fail on 192.168.8.43, but F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response. UE connects via DU, RRC setup succeeds. AMF association fails due to SCTP bind failure. Anomalies: Bind failures suggest interface not configured, but F1AP works. Cross-reference: cu_conf.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43" matches failed bind.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, detailed PHY/RU logs despite global_log_level="error", F1AP connects to CU, receives F1 Setup Response. Rfsim server starts, UE connects, RA succeeds, RRC establishes, data flows. No errors, but log level may suppress lower level messages. Link to network_config: du_conf.log_config.global_log_level="error" may hide debug info, but logs show operation works.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs show repeated band info, Harq stats. DU logs confirm UE connects and data transfers. Link to network_config: ue_conf.rfsimulator matches DU operation.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timeline: DU starts with restrictive logging, but F1AP/UE operation succeeds, CU establishes F1AP, UE connects successfully, data flows. CU fails AMF association due to 192.168.8.43 bind issues. Root cause: log_config.global_log_level="error" too restrictive, suppresses info/debug logs needed for diagnosis, though logs show success (possibly specific levels override), configuration wrong for debugging. CU bind issues separate.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set du_conf.log_config.global_log_level to "info" for proper log visibility. For CU AMF issues, ensure 192.168.8.43 interface configured. Debug: Check log output with "info" level, verify no suppressed issues. Tools: Test with corrected config, monitor logs for hidden problems. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"log_config": {"global_log_level": "info", ...}}, ...}  # global_log_level changed from "error" to "info" for better log visibility
