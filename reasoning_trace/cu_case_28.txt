Overall Context and Setup Assumptions:
This scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for User Equipment (UE) emulation. The setup uses a Control Unit (CU) and Distributed Unit (DU) split architecture, with F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) for CU-DU communication, NG Application Protocol (NGAP) for CU-AMF communication, and GTP-U for user plane (N3 interface). Expected flow: component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1 setup between CU and DU, UE random access (PRACH), RRC connection establishment, PDU session setup, and data exchange. Potential issues include configuration mismatches in network interfaces (e.g., invalid IPs, ports), binding failures for sockets (SCTP for F1AP/NGAP, UDP for GTP-U), ASN.1 encoding failures, or AMF association failures preventing NGAP procedures.

Parsed network_config: cu_conf includes gNBs with NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.70.132", GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=0 (invalid, as ports must be 1-65535). du_conf has servingCellConfigCommon with prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (likely "127.0.0.1" or loopback). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Key mismatches: GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=0 is invalid; GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="192.168.8.43" may not be a local interface on the host.

Analyzing CU Logs:
CU initialization proceeds normally: nfapi running in MONOLITHIC mode, gNB tasks initialized, threads created for TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB. SCTP bind attempt for 127.0.0.5:501 fails with errno 99 ("Cannot assign requested address"), leading to "could not open socket, no SCTP connection established". GTPU configuration for address 192.168.8.43:2152 fails to bind ("Cannot assign requested address"). Subsequently, GTPU attempts bind for 127.0.0.5:2152, which succeeds, but "Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener" and GTPU instance id=-1. F1AP starts successfully, F1 Setup Request/Response exchanged with DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), UE context created (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 26949), RRC Setup succeeds, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. However, NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB", indicating AMF association failure.

Analyzing DU Logs:
DU initialization normal: RU (Radio Unit) configured with rfsim, threads started, RF ready. UE performs RA procedure (preamble 0, energy 54.0 dB), Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchanged successfully, UE RNTI 6945 in-sync, data exchange ongoing (TX/RX bytes increasing, BLER low). No errors in DU logs.

Analyzing UE Logs:
UE logs repetitive, indicating successful physical layer operation: NR band 78 TDD, HARQ rounds 8-11, no errors. No connection failures or attempts to reconnect, suggesting UE perceives connection as established.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis:
CU SCTP bind fails for F1AP (127.0.0.5:501), but F1AP proceeds (perhaps fallback or non-blocking). GTPU bind fails for N3 (192.168.8.43:2152) due to invalid address, but succeeds for 127.0.0.5:2152, yet GTPU instance creation fails ("Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener"), resulting in no N3 interface. F1AP succeeds, UE connects via DU, RRC establishes, but AMF association fails ("No AMF is associated"), preventing NGAP/PDU session. UE stuck at RRC_CONNECTED without progressing to PDU session. Misconfigured_param "gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=0" is invalid (ports 0 invalid per networking standards and OAI defaults 2152). In OAI SA mode, GTPU uses NGU config, but code may use GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U for port (bug or config issue), setting port=0. Bind fails for invalid port (errno 99 may encompass port/address issues). IP "192.168.8.43" invalid (not local), exacerbating bind failure. Root cause: invalid port 0 for GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U causes GTPU bind failure, preventing N3 setup and AMF association despite successful F1AP/RRC.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis:
Fix config to set valid port: update cu_conf gNBs NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152. Also correct invalid IP: set GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="127.0.0.5" (local loopback). Debug: check host interfaces (ip addr), verify ports not in use (netstat). Re-run with corrected config; expect GTPU bind success, N3 setup, AMF association, PDU session. If issues persist, check OAI code for port usage (grep GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U in e1ap_setup.c).
