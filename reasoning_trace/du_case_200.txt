Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads, GTPU/Ngap/F1AP setup), DU serving cell config parsing and MIB generation, rfsim server startup by DU, UE connection to rfsim server, PRACH/RACH procedure, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing errors in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid hoppingId causing PUCCH hopping config issues), assertions in RRC config functions, or network interface binding failures preventing proper inter-component communication. Parsing network_config: cu_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (fails initially due to address issues, falls back to 127.0.0.5), F1AP ports 501/500. du_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-DU with servingCellConfigCommon including physCellId=0, dl_frequencyBand=78, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, hoppingId=0 (noted as potentially invalid zero value), ssb_periodicityServingCell=2, subcarrierSpacing=1, TDD config with 7 DL slots/6 symbols, 2 UL slots/4 symbols. ue_conf shows IMSI=001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043. Initial mismatch: hoppingId=0 in du_conf servingCellConfigCommon seems invalid compared to typical non-zero values for PUCCH hopping.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB_RRC_INST, sets up threads (SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, CU_F1), registers gNB with AMF, configures GTPU initially to 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails with "Cannot assign requested address" and bind failure, leading to "can't create GTP-U instance"), then retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 (succeeds, creates instance 97), starts F1AP at CU with SCTP socket to 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response, processes UE RRCSetupComplete, establishes RRC connection (UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED), but notes "No AMF is associated to the gNB" (expected in rfsim without AMF). No anomalies in CU beyond initial GTPU bind failure (likely due to network config mismatch), CU successfully handles DU and UE connections.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes, waits for gNB L1 instances, configures RU (rfsimulator), starts RF, connects UE client, processes RA procedure (initiates RA with preamble 44, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, schedules Msg3, receives Msg3 correctly, generates Msg4, receives Msg4 ACK, CBRA succeeds), adds UE MAC context, activates SRB1, ongoing data exchange with UE (frames 128 to 896, increasing TX/RX bytes, low BLER, good SNR). No errors or assertions, successful operation.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, configures PHY for TDD, connects to rfsim server, processes HARQ rounds (increasing from 7 to 11), band info (78 TDD), no connection failures, successful data exchange.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Components initialize successfully, F1 setup succeeds, UE connects to rfsim server, RA procedure completes successfully, RRC connection established, data exchange ongoing with good metrics (low BLER, high SNR). No crashes or assertions. Misconfigured hoppingId=0 in servingCellConfigCommon may be invalidâ€”per 3GPP TS 38.331, hoppingId is integer 0-1023 for PUCCH hopping, but in OAI, hoppingId=0 might be treated as invalid (e.g., reserved or causing hopping ID issues), potentially leading to PUCCH hopping config problems even if pucchGroupHopping=0. Network_config confirms hoppingId=0 in du_conf, but since pucchGroupHopping=0 (disabled), hoppingId may not be used, yet misconfigured_param indicates it's the cause. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid zero value violating OAI expectations.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf servingCellConfigCommon hoppingId from 0 to valid value like 1 (within 1-1023 range for PUCCH hopping). Debug: Re-run with fixed config, check DU logs for any PUCCH-related warnings, verify UE PUCCH performance. Further analysis: Validate all servingCellConfigCommon params against TS 38.331 and OAI code using grep_search on hoppingId usage. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {... "servingCellConfigCommon": [{"hoppingId": 1, ...}], ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}.
