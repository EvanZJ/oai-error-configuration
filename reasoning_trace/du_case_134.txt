Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (--rfsim --sa options), where CU, DU, and UE components run in monolithic mode. Expected flow: DU initializes first (parsing config, setting up L1/PHY/MAC), starts rfsimulator server for radio emulation, then CU initializes (NGAP/F1AP setup, AMF connection), and UE connects to rfsim server for PRACH/RRC/PDU session establishment. Potential issues: Config parsing failures in DU (e.g., empty arrays causing assertions), bind failures in CU (IP address issues), UE connection failures to rfsim server if DU doesn't start. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43. du_conf has Active_gNBs=[], gNBs array with one gNB (gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name=gNB-Eurecom-DU), MACRLCs/L1s/RUs arrays populated, rfsimulator with serveraddr="server" (but UE expects 127.0.0.1), fhi_72 with valid fh_config. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Mismatch: du_conf Active_gNBs=[] (empty array) vs. misconfigured_param "Active_gNBs=[]", indicating structural config error causing DU startup failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully up to thread creation (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1, TASK_GTPV1_U). Registers gNB[0] with NGAP, checks AMF registration. However, SCTP bind fails ("Cannot assign requested address" errno 99), GTPU bind fails similarly ("Cannot assign requested address"), creating gtpu instance id=-1 and failing E1AP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5:2152, accepts CU-UP ID 3584. No further progress due to DU crash preventing F1AP connection. Cross-reference: NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43 may not be available on this system, but primary issue is DU not starting.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts initialization (nfapi monolithic, getting GNBSParams, HW version), creates RC.gNB pointer. Immediately hits assertion "Assertion (num_gnbs > 0) failed!" in RCconfig_NR_L1() at gnb_config.c:800, with error "Failed to parse config file no gnbs Active_gNBs". Exits execution with "_Assert_Exit_". Config parsing succeeds initially (libconfig loaded, parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst=0, nb_nr_L1_inst=1, nb_ru=1), but fails at L1 config due to empty Active_gNBs. Cross-reference: du_conf Active_gNBs=[] matches misconfigured_param, causing num_gnbs=0 assertion. gNBs array is populated but Active_gNBs list is empty, preventing DU from recognizing any active gNBs.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY (samples_per_subframe=61440, UE vars for 1 TX/1 RX ant), configures HW for 8 cards (TDD duplex, freq 3619200000 Hz, gains 0/110), creates threads (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE). Runs as rfsim client, tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but connect() fails with errno(111) "Connection refused". No successful connection, so UE hangs in connect loop. Cross-reference: ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1 matches attempts, but du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (not 127.0.0.1), though primary issue is DU not starting server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crashes immediately due to assertion failure from Active_gNBs=[] in du_conf, preventing rfsim server startup. This causes UE connect failures (errno 111). CU initializes but can't establish F1AP to DU (no DU running), and has bind issues on 192.168.8.43 (possibly network config mismatch). Timeline: DU exits at config parse, UE starts connect loop immediately, CU proceeds to F1AP start but stalls. Hypothesis: Active_gNBs=[] violates OAI config requirement for at least one active gNB (num_gnbs > 0 assertion in gnb_config.c). This is a structural config error, not parameter value issue. Guided by misconfigured_param "Active_gNBs=[]", root cause is empty array preventing DU initialization. No need for external tools, as OAI code patterns show assertions for config validity.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix du_conf Active_gNBs from [] to ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"] to match gNBs array name. This ensures num_gnbs > 0, allowing DU startup and rfsim server. Debug: Run DU alone first to verify config parse, check system IPs for CU bind issues. Tools: Use OAI logs with --verbose, check /proc/net/route for IP availability. Corrected network_config: cu_conf unchanged. du_conf: Active_gNBs: ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"] (add this array with the gNB name). ue_conf unchanged. Limitations: Logs truncated at DU exit, no timestamps for precise timing, incomplete JSON if more config sections exist.
