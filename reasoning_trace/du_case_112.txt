Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using --rfsim --sa options, where the DU acts as an rfsimulator server for UE radio emulation, CU handles control plane (NGAP/F1AP), and UE connects to the rfsim server for PHY layer simulation. Expected flow: DU starts first as rfsim server, CU initializes and binds to interfaces (e.g., 192.168.8.43 for GTPU/NGAP), establishes F1AP with DU, then UE connects to rfsim server (127.0.0.1:4043) for radio simulation, followed by PRACH/RRC/PDU session setup. Potential issues: Config parsing failures (libconfig syntax errors) preventing DU startup, bind failures on CU interfaces, UE connection refused to rfsim server. network_config parsing: cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs with gNB_ID=0xe00, amf_ip_address=192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43. du_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with nr_cellid=1, prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, and rfsimulator=null (invalid null value causing syntax error). ue_conf has rfsim=1, rfsimulator with serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Mismatch: rfsimulator=null in du_conf is invalid for libconfig, unlike ue_conf's proper object.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC/PDCP instances, starts threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. NGAP registers gNB[0] with id 3584, checks AMF registration. SCTP bindx fails for 192.168.8.43 (errno 99: cannot assign requested address), GTPU bind fails for same address/port 2152, creating gtpu instance id=-1, failing CUUP N3 UDP listener. Then creates another GTPU instance id=97 for 127.0.0.5:2152, starts F1AP at CU, accepts CU-UP ID 3584. Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest interface not available or already in use, but CU proceeds with local loopback (127.0.0.5) for F1AP/GTPU, waiting for DU connection. No direct link to misconfigured_param, but partial success indicates CU can init despite binds, but DU failure prevents full setup.

Analyzing DU Logs: Immediately fails with libconfig syntax error at line 230 in du_case_112.conf, config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded, log init aborted, config_get calls skipped, nfapi integer unavailable, "Getting configuration failed". CMDLINE shows --rfsim --sa -O du_case_112.conf, path set to auto_run_gnb_ue, config_libconfig_init returns -1. DU never starts, no PHY/MAC init, no rfsim server launched. Crash point: Syntax error prevents any DU execution, directly tied to invalid config.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars for gNB TXant=1, UE RXant=1, configures 8 cards (0-7) with sample_rate=61440000, duplex_mode=TDD, freq=3619200000 Hz, gains set. Creates threads for UEthread/L1_UE_stats/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE. HW runs as client, loads RFSIMULATOR device, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail with errno(111): connection refused. No connection established, UE loops on connect attempts. Anomalies: Repeated failures indicate rfsim server not running (DU not started), UE can't proceed to PRACH/RRC.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU partially starts but bind failures on 192.168.8.43 (possibly due to no AMF or interface issues) don't halt it, proceeds with F1AP on loopback waiting for DU. DU fails immediately due to libconfig syntax error at line 230, preventing config load and startup, so no rfsim server for UE. UE connect failures correlate with DU not running. Misconfigured_param "rfsimulator=None" in du_conf sets rfsimulator to null, invalid for libconfig (expects object or omission), causing syntax error. In OAI rfsim mode, DU needs valid rfsimulator config to act as server; null triggers parse failure. Hypothesis: rfsimulator=null violates libconfig syntax, aborting DU init, preventing rfsim server, causing UE connect refused. CU proceeds but can't connect to DU, leading to stalled setup. No external tools needed; based on OAI patterns where invalid nulls cause libconfig errors (seen in prior cases like Asn1_verbosity=null).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change rfsimulator in du_conf from null to a valid object, e.g., {} if no specific config needed, or match ue_conf style if server settings required (though DU is server). This resolves syntax error, allows DU startup as rfsim server, enables UE connection. Debug: Check config file line 230 for rfsimulator=null, validate with libconfig parser. Further: Ensure CU interface 192.168.8.43 is available or use loopback. Corrected network_config: cu_conf unchanged. du_conf: change "rfsimulator": null to "rfsimulator": {} (empty object to avoid syntax error while maintaining rfsim mode). ue_conf unchanged.
