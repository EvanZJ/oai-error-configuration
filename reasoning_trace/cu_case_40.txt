Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) setup in CU/DU split mode with rfsim for UE simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in the CU and DU command lines. The expected flow is: CU initializes and starts NGAP/AMF connection, DU initializes PHY/MAC and connects to CU via F1AP/SCTP, UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, then proceeds to PRACH/RACH, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid security algorithms), bind failures (e.g., invalid IPs), connection timeouts, or assertions in code. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs ["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs section with gNB_ID "0xe00", local_s_address "127.0.0.5", remote_s_address "127.0.0.3", amf_ip_address "192.168.70.132", security.ciphering_algorithms ["nea3","nea6","nea1","nea0"], integrity_algorithms ["nia2","nia0"]. du_conf has Active_gNBs ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with gNB_ID "0xe00", local_n_address "127.0.0.3", remote_n_address "127.0.0.5", rfsimulator serveraddr "server". ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", serverport "4043". Initial mismatch: cu_conf security.ciphering_algorithms includes "nea6", which is invalid per 3GPP TS 33.501 (valid are nea0-nea3), conflicting with misconfigured_param "security.ciphering_algorithms[1]=nea6".

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode (nfapi running), gets GNBSParams, OPT disabled, HW version logged, PHY creates tasks, RC.gNB allocated, no prs_config, create_gNB_tasks nb_nr_L1_inst:0, allocates gNB_RRC_INST, F1AP gNB_CU_id 3584, gNB_CU_name "gNB-Eurecom-CU", SDAP disabled, Data Radio Bearer count 1, do_SIB23_NR size 9, then error "[RRC] unknown ciphering algorithm \"nea6\" in section \"security\" of the configuration file", command line -O /home/sionna/evan/CursorAutomation/cursor_gen_conf/auto_run_gnb_ue/cu_case_40.conf, libconfig loaded, parallel_conf 2, worker_conf 1, Configuration nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 0, nb_ru 0 (RAU/RRU), Southbound Transport f1. No AMF connection or GTPU/NGAP setup occurs. Anomalies: Unknown ciphering algorithm error, incomplete logs (no further init), stalled at config verification, no threads or interfaces started beyond error.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts with libconfig loaded, parallel_conf 2, worker_conf 1, Configuration nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 1, nb_ru 1 (RAU/RRU), initializes northbound interface for L1, DL/UL frequency 3619200000, F1AP interfaces for MACRLC, MeasurementTimingConfiguration logged, PHY create_gNB_tasks RC.nb_nr_L1_inst:1, l1_north_init_gNB, callbacks installed, allocates gNB_RRC_INST, SDAP disabled, Data Radio Bearer count 1, no preferred ciphering/integrity (defaults applied), threads for SCTP/GNB_APP/GTPV1_U/DU_F1 created, gNB 0 initialized, F1AP starting at DU, F1-C DU IPaddr 127.0.0.3 connect to F1-C CU 127.0.0.5, GTPU UDP init 127.0.0.3:2152, gtpu instance 98, SCTP Connect failed: Connection refused, F1AP retrying, RU GPIO/generic, clock internal, L1 instances 1, RU 1, CPU cores 20, RU proc 0 initialized, thread pool, waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio, continued SCTP failures. No crash, but stuck retrying F1AP connection. Anomalies: Repeated Connection refused (errno 111), indicating CU not listening.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY samples_per_subframe 61440, UE vars for gNB TXant 1 RXant 1, prs_config skipped, symbol rotation for 3619200000 Hz, N_TA_offset 800, HW configuring cards 0-7 for TDD, tx/rx freq 3619200000, gains, UE threads initialized, TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE created, running as client to rfsimulator server, connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed errno(111) Connection refused, repeated attempts, UICC sim IMSI=001010000000101, etc. Anomalies: All connect attempts fail with errno(111), no successful connection to rfsim server, UE stuck in connection loop.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU detects unknown ciphering algorithm "nea6" in security section, causing config failure and preventing proper CU startup (no NGAP/AMF, no SCTP listen). DU initializes fully but F1AP/SCTP connect to CU fails with Connection refused, as CU isn't running correctly to accept connections on 127.0.0.5:500/501. UE can't connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043, because DU's rfsimulator serveraddr is "server" (not "127.0.0.1"), but more critically, DU isn't activating radio due to waiting for F1 Setup Response, which never comes. Timeline: CU config error → CU partial startup fails → DU retries F1AP indefinitely → UE retries rfsim indefinitely. Misconfigured_param "security.ciphering_algorithms[1]=nea6" directly causes RRC config failure, as per 3GPP TS 33.501, valid ciphering algorithms are nea0 (null), nea1 (128-NEA1), nea2 (128-NEA2), nea3 (128-NEA3); nea6 is invalid. Hypothesis: Invalid ciphering algorithm causes CU to skip security setup, leading to startup issues and connection failures. No need for external tools, as OAI RRC code validates algorithms.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix cu_conf security.ciphering_algorithms from ["nea3","nea6","nea1","nea0"] to ["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"] (replace nea6 with nea2). Also, align du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr from "server" to "127.0.0.1" for UE connection. Debug: Run CU separately, check logs for no unknown algorithm error, then DU for F1AP success, then UE for rfsim connect. Tools: Use grep in OAI RRC code for ciphering algorithm validation. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"security": {"ciphering_algorithms": ["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"]}}, "du_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"}}, "ue_conf": {...}}.
