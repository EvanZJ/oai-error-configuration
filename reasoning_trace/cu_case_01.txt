Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) mode deployment using radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for testing. The setup consists of three main components: CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment). Expected flow involves: component initialization → F1 interface setup between CU and DU → NGAP setup with AMF → UE random access (PRACH) → RRC connection → PDU session establishment. Key potential issues to look for include configuration mismatches, thread allocation problems, network interface binding failures, and protocol handshake errors. The network_config shows cu_conf with Num_Threads_PUSCH=-1 (invalid negative value), du_conf with comprehensive TDD configuration for band 78, and ue_conf with rfsimulator settings. Initial analysis shows Num_Threads_PUSCH=-1 as a clear configuration error since thread counts must be non-negative.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization shows successful thread creation for TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1, and TASK_GTPV1_U. However, critical failures occur: SCTP bindx fails with "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99), preventing SCTP connection establishment. GTPU initialization also fails with bind error for address 192.168.8.43:2152, resulting in "can't create GTP-U instance" and "Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener". Despite these failures, F1AP setup succeeds with DU connection (assoc_id 4), UE context creation (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 6150), and RRC setup completion. The CU reaches NR_RRC_CONNECTED state but shows "No AMF is associated to the gNB", indicating NGAP connection failure. Cross-referencing with network_config, the cu_conf shows NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU both set to 192.168.8.43, which matches the failed GTPU bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization is successful with RU (Radio Unit) configuration using librfsimulator.so, proper antenna setup (4x4 MIMO), and TDD configuration for band 78. Random access procedure completes successfully: PRACH detection at frame 151.19, RA-Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchange, and contention resolution. UE achieves stable connection with good signal metrics (RSRP -44 dB, SNR 57.0 dB, BLER decreasing over time). Statistics show normal UL/DL traffic with increasing frame counts (256.0, 384.0, 512.0, etc.) and stable MCS 9. No PHY/MAC errors or assertions are present. The DU appears fully functional and can communicate with both CU (via F1) and UE (via rfsim).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE shows repetitive band 78 TDD configuration confirmations and Harq round statistics progressing from 8/0/0 to 12/0/0 downlink rounds, indicating active communication. No connection failures or errors are evident - the UE appears to be successfully connected and exchanging data with the network via rfsimulator. The ue_conf shows proper rfsimulator configuration with serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043", matching the DU's rfsimulator settings.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The Num_Threads_PUSCH=-1 configuration in cu_conf is the root cause. This invalid negative value likely causes thread allocation failures in the CU's PUSCH processing, leading to resource exhaustion or improper initialization that prevents network interface binding. The SCTP and GTPU binding failures (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address") are symptoms of this underlying thread management issue. Timeline correlation shows CU initialization partially succeeds (F1AP works), but network-facing services fail, while DU and UE operate normally. The DU-UE communication succeeds because it bypasses the CU's problematic PUSCH thread handling via direct F1 interface. This explains why RRC connection works but AMF association fails - the CU can handle F1 signaling but cannot establish external network connections due to thread allocation issues.


Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change Num_Threads_PUSCH from -1 to a valid positive value (e.g., 1 or 2) in cu_conf. Verify network interface addresses are accessible and not conflicting. Test with corrected configuration to ensure SCTP/GTPU binding succeeds. Monitor thread creation logs and system resources during initialization. If issues persist, check for race conditions in thread initialization or conflicts with other system processes using the same ports.

Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "Num_Threads_PUSCH": 1  // Changed from -1 to valid positive value
  }
}
