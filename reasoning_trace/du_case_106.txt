Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves OAI 5G NR SA mode with rfsim, as evidenced by DU logs showing --rfsim --sa options and UE attempting rfsim connection. The expected flow is component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, UE random access (PRACH), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures from empty Active_gNBs, bind errors on network interfaces, or DU startup failures preventing rfsim server. Parsing network_config: du_conf has Active_gNBs=[], gNBs array present but empty active list; cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"]; ue_conf has rfsimulator settings. Initial mismatch: Active_gNBs=[] in du_conf violates requirement for at least one active gNB.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPV1_U, CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode on 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails bind ("Cannot assign requested address"), leading to GTPU instance failure (-1) and E1AP CUUP N3 UDP listener failure. SCTP also fails bind on same address. Despite this, F1AP starts on 127.0.0.5, GTPU creates instance on loopback (97). Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest IP/interface issues, but F1AP proceeds on loopback. No F1 Setup Request received, indicating DU failure. Cross-reference: network_config cu_conf has NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU as 192.168.8.43, matching failed bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts initialization, loads config, but hits "Assertion (num_gnbs > 0) failed!" in RCconfig_NR_L1() at gnb_config.c:800, "Failed to parse config file no gnbs Active_gNBs", and exits execution. No further processing occurs. Links to network_config: du_conf has Active_gNBs=[], causing num_gnbs=0 and assertion failure.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes threads (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE), loads rfsimulator device, attempts connection to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but all fail with errno(111) (connection refused). No successful connection or RA. Links to network_config: ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1":4043, matching failed attempts.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines show CU initializes but waits for DU F1 Setup (not received); DU crashes immediately on config assertion; UE fails to connect due to no rfsim server. Root cause: Active_gNBs=[] in du_conf invalidates config, as OAI requires at least one active gNB name in Active_gNBs to set num_gnbs > 0. Empty array causes assertion failure in gnb_config.c, preventing DU startup and rfsim server. CU bind issues unrelated but compound problem. Hypothesis: Active_gNBs must contain gNB names from gNBs array for valid config parsing.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf Active_gNBs to ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"]. For CU bind, verify 192.168.8.43 interface. Debug: Check OAI config docs for Active_gNBs requirements. Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"]}}. Limitations: Logs truncated; assertion prevents further DU logs.
