Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: The scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) in Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulator (rfsim), as indicated by the command-line options --rfsim --sa in the logs. The expected flow is component initialization (CU, DU, UE), followed by F1/NGAP setup between CU and DU, AMF connection, UE attachment via PRACH, RRC connection establishment, and PDU session setup. Potential issues include config syntax errors, invalid parameters causing config load failures, and connection failures. Parsing the network_config JSON: gnb_conf (DU config) includes plmn_list=null, which is invalid. ue_conf includes rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatches noted: The config sets plmn_list=null, causing libconfig syntax error.

Analyzing CU Logs: The CU initializes successfully, creates tasks, starts F1AP listener, but no F1 Setup received due to DU failure.

Analyzing DU Logs: Config loading fails with "[LIBCONFIG] file ... - line 18: syntax error", "config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded", "Getting configuration failed". DU exits without starting.

Analyzing UE Logs: The UE initializes, attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, but connect() fails repeatedly (errno=111), as the server is not running due to DU failure.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The DU fails to load config due to syntax error from plmn_list=null, preventing DU startup, F1 connection, and rfsim server. CU waits, UE can't connect. Guided by the misconfigured parameter, the root cause is plmn_list=null causing libconfig syntax error, violating config format requirements.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update plmn_list to valid object, e.g., {"mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2, "snssaiList": [{"sst": 1, "sd": "0x010203"}]}. Debug by checking config syntax, use libconfig validator. Tools: Review OAI config docs, test config parsing. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"plmn_list": {"mcc": 1, "mnc": 1, "mnc_length": 2, "snssaiList": [{"sst": 1, "sd": "0x010203"}]}}]}} â€“ this changes plmn_list from null to valid object.

Limitations: Logs show DU config failure immediately; truncated logs; incomplete JSON may omit details.
