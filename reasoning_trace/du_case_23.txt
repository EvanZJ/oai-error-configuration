Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: The scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) in Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulator (rfsim), as indicated by the command-line options --rfsim --sa in the logs. The expected flow is component initialization (CU, DU, UE), followed by F1/NGAP setup between CU and DU, AMF connection, UE attachment via PRACH, RRC connection establishment, and PDU session setup. Potential issues include configuration mismatches in PUCCH parameters, ASN.1 encoding failures, and connection failures. Parsing the network_config JSON: gnb_conf (DU config) includes hoppingId=-1 in servingCellConfigCommon, which is invalid. ue_conf includes rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatches noted: The config sets hoppingId=-1, which violates 3GPP TS 38.331 range (0-1023).

Analyzing CU Logs: The CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPU. It sets gNB_CU_id=3584, registers with NGAP, starts F1AP with SCTP listener on 127.0.0.5. GTPU bind fails, but alternative bind succeeds. F1AP starts, but no F1 Setup received due to DU crash. CU waits indefinitely.

Analyzing DU Logs: The DU initializes, configures PHY/MAC, reads ServingCellConfigCommon with hoppingId=-1. During PUCCH config cloning, ASN.1 encoding fails (enc_rval.encoded invalid), triggering assertion in clone_pucch_configcommon(). DU exits before F1 Setup, preventing rfsim server start.

Analyzing UE Logs: The UE initializes, attempts to connect to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, but connect() fails repeatedly (errno=111), as the server is not running due to DU crash.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The DU crashes early during config processing due to invalid hoppingId=-1, which causes PUCCH_ConfigCommon ASN.1 encoding failure. This prevents DU startup, F1 connection, and rfsim server, leading to UE connection failures. The misconfigured hoppingId=-1 violates 3GPP TS 38.331 (PUCCH-ConfigCommon hoppingId range 0-1023), causing encoding failure. Guided by the misconfigured parameter, the root cause is invalid hoppingId=-1 leading to ASN.1 encoding failure in PUCCH config.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update hoppingId to a valid value, e.g., 0. Debug by checking ASN.1 encoding logs, verify 3GPP TS 38.331. Tools: Review OAI RRC config code, use ASN.1 tools for validation. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"hoppingId": 0}]}]}} â€“ this changes hoppingId from -1 to 0, ensuring valid ASN.1 encoding.

Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps; incomplete JSON may omit details; DU crash prevents further logs.
