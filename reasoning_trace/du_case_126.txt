Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (--rfsim --sa options), where CU, DU, and UE components run separately. Expected flow: DU initializes L1/PHY/MAC, starts rfsimulator server for radio emulation, CU handles NGAP/F1AP for AMF connection and F1 setup with DU, UE connects to rfsim server for radio link. Potential issues: Config parsing failures in DU causing early exit (e.g., empty Active_gNBs array leading to num_gnbs=0 assertion), preventing rfsim server startup, resulting in UE connection failures. Network_config parsed: gnb_conf (du_conf) has Active_gNBs=[], gNBs array with one gNB object (gNB_name "gNB-Eurecom-DU"), MACRLCs/L1s/RUs arrays populated, rfsimulator with serveraddr "server" (mismatch with UE's "127.0.0.1"?), fhi_72 present; ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" port 4043. Initial mismatch: Active_gNBs=[] in du_conf violates requirement for at least one active gNB, causing DU assertion failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully in monolithic mode, creates threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU/F1AP. Registers gNB[0] with NGAP, checks AMF registration. SCTP bind fails for 192.168.8.43 (address not available), GTPU bind fails for same IP/port, falls back to 127.0.0.5 for GTPU instance 97. F1AP starts at CU, attempts SCTP connection to 127.0.0.5:501 (remote DU). No anomalies in CU init; it proceeds to wait for DU connection, but DU fails early.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts monolithic mode, gets GNBSParams, disables OPT, sets RC.gNB. Then hits assertion "num_gnbs > 0 failed" in RCconfig_NR_L1() at gnb_config.c:800, with message "Failed to parse config file no gnbs Active_gNBs". Exits execution immediately. Config parsing succeeds initially (libconfig loaded, parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst=0, nb_nr_L1_inst=1, nb_ru=1), but Active_gNBs=[] causes num_gnbs=0, triggering assert. No further init (PHY/MAC threads, rfsim server) occurs.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars for TDD, configures multiple RF cards (0-7) with freq 3619200000 Hz, gains 0/110. Creates threads for UEthread/L1_UE_stats/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE. Loads RFSIMULATOR device, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but connect() fails with errno 111 (connection refused). No successful connection; UE loops on failed attempts. rfsimulator config in ue_conf matches (127.0.0.1:4043), but server not running due to DU failure.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU assertion failure prevents rfsim server startup, causing UE connect failures; CU initializes but can't connect to DU via F1AP (no DU running). Misconfigured_param "Active_gNBs=[]" in du_conf directly causes num_gnbs=0, violating OAI requirement for at least one active gNB (per gnb_config.c assert). This is a structural config error, similar to empty arrays in prior cases, leading to libconfig parsing success but runtime assert in RCconfig_NR_L1. No external tools needed; root cause is clear from logs ("no gnbs Active_gNBs") and config mismatch (Active_gNBs=[] vs. expected non-empty array like ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"]).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf Active_gNBs to ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"] to match gNBs[0].gNB_name and enable DU init. Debug: Check gnb_config.c for assert logic; run with corrected config to verify rfsim server starts, UE connects. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {"Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], ... rest unchanged ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}.
