Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (radio frequency simulator), where the DU acts as the rfsimulator server and the UE acts as the client connecting to it. The expected flow is: CU initialization with NGAP to AMF, DU initialization with F1AP to CU, RU setup with rfsimulator, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in rfsimulator parameters (e.g., serveraddr invalid causing bind failures), IP address misconfigurations leading to bind errors, or timing issues in TDD mode. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="invalid" (invalid IP, should be valid like "127.0.0.1"), serverport=4043, modelname="AWGN"; ue_conf includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043", modelname="AWGN". Key params: DU rfsimulator serveraddr invalid mismatches UE client addr, CU NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43" and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="192.168.8.43" (potentially invalid IPs causing bind fails).

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC/GTPU. SCTP bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for errno 99, GTPU bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for 192.168.8.43:2152, E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, connects to DU at 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response. UE connects, RRC decodes CCCH, creates UE context, RRCSetup, NR_RRCSetupComplete, but NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB" (likely due to AMF IP 192.168.70.132 being unreachable or invalid). Cross-reference: NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs "192.168.8.43" invalid, causing bind fails, but F1AP local loopback works.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU waits for gNB L1, initializes RU threads, configures RU from file, loads librfsimulator.so, sets RU 0 with nr_band 78, half-slot parallelization 1. RU RF started "opp_enabled 0", "No connected device, generating void samples..." (indicates rfsim not connecting). UE RA procedure initiates, Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 succeed, UE connects with RNTI 8915, in-sync, good RSRP -44, BLER decreasing, data TX/RX increasing. No crashes or assertions, but "generating void samples" suggests rfsim server not bound. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="invalid" prevents server bind, so UE can't connect properly despite RA success.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repetitive NR band 78 TDD info, Harq round stats increasing (8/0/0 to 11/0/0), but no indication of successful RRC/PDU session or data exchange. Repetitive band checks suggest UE stuck in sync/search, unable to connect to rfsim server. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches DU default, but DU serveraddr invalid prevents server startup, causing UE connect failures.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU has bind fails for 192.168.8.43 (invalid IP), preventing AMF association ("No AMF is associated"), but F1AP loopback works, DU connects. DU RA succeeds, UE in-sync with good metrics, but "No connected device, generating void samples" indicates rfsim not functional. UE repetitive logs confirm no progress beyond sync. Correlation: Invalid rfsimulator.serveraddr="invalid" in du_conf prevents DU from binding rfsim server socket, so UE client can't connect, leading to stuck UE despite RA success. CU bind issues separate (invalid AMF/NGU IPs). Hypothesis: rfsimulator.serveraddr must be valid IP (e.g., "127.0.0.1") for DU server to listen; "invalid" causes no server, UE fails to connect. Guided by misconfigured_param "rfsimulator.serveraddr=invalid", this invalid value disrupts rfsim mode operation.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix rfsimulator.serveraddr in du_conf to "127.0.0.1" to enable DU server bind. Also fix CU NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs to valid addresses (e.g., "127.0.0.1" or real IPs). Debug: Check rfsim logs for bind errors, verify UE connects after fix. Tools: Use netstat/ss to check listening sockets, tcpdump for rfsim traffic. Corrected network_config: {"gnb_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"}}, "ue_conf": {}} (UE already correct).

Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps for exact sequencing; CU bind errors may mask rfsim issues; assume rfsim mode based on librfsimulator.so load.
