Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by --rfsim --sa options in CU logs and UE connecting to rfsimulator server. Expected flow: CU initializes, loads config, sets up NGAP to AMF and F1AP to DU; DU initializes, connects to CU via F1AP/SCTP, activates radio; UE connects to rfsim server (DU's RU), performs PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Config syntax errors preventing CU init, blocking F1AP setup, causing DU SCTP failures and UE rfsim connect failures. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES={} (empty object), which mismatches misconfigured_param "gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES={}". du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (but UE uses 127.0.0.1), ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch: Empty NETWORK_INTERFACES likely invalid per OAI libconfig requirements.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts with libconfig init, but hits syntax error at line 55 in cu_case_75.conf: "[LIBCONFIG] file ... - line 55: syntax error". Config module load fails, init aborted. No further init: no threads, no NGAP/F1AP setup, no AMF connection. Logs end early, indicating config parse failure prevents any component init. This is anomalous as CU should proceed to thread creation and interface setup if config valid.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully: loads config, sets up threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_GNB_APP, etc.), starts F1AP at DU, binds GTPU to 127.0.0.3, attempts SCTP connect to CU at 127.0.0.5. But SCTP connect fails repeatedly ("Connect failed: Connection refused"), F1AP retries association. No crash, but waits indefinitely for F1 Setup Response, radio not activated ("waiting for F1 Setup Response"). No PHY/MAC errors; init completes but stalls on CU connection.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY (samples, antennas, freq 3619200000 Hz), sets up threads (UEthread, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE), loads UICC sim (IMSI=001010000000101). Runs as rfsim client, tries connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but fails with errno(111) (connection refused). No connection attempts succeed; retries indefinitely. No RRC/PDU session progress.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU fails config load due to syntax error at line 55, likely from empty NETWORK_INTERFACES={} in cu_conf, as misconfigured_param indicates. This prevents CU init, so no SCTP listener at 127.0.0.5 for DU's F1AP connect, causing DU's "Connection refused" and retries. DU can't activate radio without F1 Setup, so no rfsim server starts (RU not initialized fully), causing UE's connect failures to 127.0.0.1:4043. Timeline: CU stalls at config → DU waits on SCTP → UE waits on rfsim. Hypothesis: Empty NETWORK_INTERFACES invalid; OAI requires it for NGU/GTPU interfaces (e.g., NGU IP). Per 3GPP TS 23.501, NG interface needed for AMF; empty object causes libconfig parse fail. No tools needed; misconfigured_param guides to NETWORK_INTERFACES as root cause.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Populate gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES in cu_conf with required interfaces, e.g., NGU for AMF. Debug: Check cu_case_75.conf line 55 for syntax; validate NETWORK_INTERFACES against OAI docs. Tools: Use grep_search on OAI code for NETWORK_INTERFACES usage. Corrected configs:
