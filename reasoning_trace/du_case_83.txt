Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (radio frequency simulator), where the DU acts as the rfsimulator server and the UE acts as the client connecting to it. The expected flow is: CU initialization with NGAP to AMF, DU initialization with F1AP to CU, RU setup with rfsimulator, UE connection via PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in rfsimulator parameters (e.g., modelname invalid causing channel model failure), IP address misconfigurations leading to bind errors, or timing issues in TDD mode. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="server", serverport=4043, modelname="invalid" (invalid, should be "AWGN"), IQfile="/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs"; ue_conf includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043", modelname="AWGN". Key params: DU rfsimulator modelname="invalid" invalid (not recognized channel model, causes find_channel_desc_fromname to fail), UE modelname="AWGN" correct.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates tasks for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC/GTPU. SCTP bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for errno 99, GTPU bind fails "Cannot assign requested address" for 192.168.8.43:2152, E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, connects to DU at 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response. UE connects, RRC decodes CCCH, creates UE context, RRCSetup, NR_RRCSetupComplete, but NGAP reports "No AMF is associated to the gNB" (likely due to AMF IP 192.168.70.132 being unreachable or invalid). Cross-reference: NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs "192.168.8.43" invalid, causing bind fails, but F1AP loopback works.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU with rfsimulator, loads librfsimulator.so, sets RF config, attaches antennas, starts threads. "RU 0 RF started opp_enabled 0", "A client connects, sending the current time" (rfsim connection succeeds), then RA procedure initiates, Msg3/Msg4 succeed, UE connects with RNTI 8f1f, in-sync, good RSRP -44, BLER decreasing, data TX/RX increasing. No crashes or assertions, but channel model may not be set due to invalid modelname. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.modelname="invalid" causes find_channel_desc_fromname to return NULL, LOG_E "Channel model invalid not found", preventing proper channel simulation.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repetitive NR band 78 TDD info, Harq round stats increasing (7/0/0 to 11/0/0), but no indication of successful RRC/PDU session or data exchange progress. Repetitive band checks suggest UE stuck in sync/search, unable to establish effective communication. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.modelname="AWGN" correct, but DU modelname invalid causes channel model mismatch, disrupting I/Q processing.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU has bind fails for 192.168.8.43 (invalid IP), preventing AMF association, but F1AP works, UE RRC succeeds. DU shows rfsim client connection and RA success, data exchange, but UE logs repetitive without progress. Correlation: Invalid rfsimulator.modelname="invalid" in du_conf causes channel model lookup failure, preventing proper channel simulation in rfsim, leading to ineffective UE communication despite RA success. Guided by misconfigured_param "rfsimulator.modelname=invalid", this invalid value disrupts rfsim channel modeling.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix rfsimulator.modelname in du_conf to "AWGN" to match UE and default. Also fix CU NETWORK_INTERFACES IPs to valid addresses (e.g., "127.0.0.1" or real IPs). Debug: Check rfsim logs for "Channel model not found" error, verify UE data exchange after fix. Tools: Use grep for LOG_E in rfsim logs, tcpdump for I/Q traffic. Corrected network_config: {"gnb_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"modelname": "AWGN"}}, "ue_conf": {}} (UE already correct).

Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps for exact sequencing; CU bind errors may mask rfsim issues; assume rfsim mode based on device load.
