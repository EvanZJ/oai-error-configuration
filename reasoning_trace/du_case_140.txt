Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: DU initializes with config, starts rfsim server; CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP and to DU via F1AP; UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, performs PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session. Potential issues include config parsing errors causing DU startup failure, preventing rfsim server availability and leading to UE connection failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with servingCellConfigCommon including prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, SCTP settings, MACRLCs/L1s/RUs arrays, rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"server","serverport":4043}, fhi_72 with fh_config, but log_config=null. ue_conf has rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"127.0.0.1","serverport":"4043"}, imsi, etc. Initial mismatch: log_config=null in du_conf likely causes libconfig syntax error, as null is invalid for log_config section.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, initializes PHY/L1/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, sets up threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU. GTPU tries to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. NGAP registers gNB, checks AMF state. F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5. No anomalies in CU init itself, but SCTP bind failure on 192.168.8.43 suggests network config mismatch (NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="192.168.8.43" may not be available). CU proceeds to wait for DU connection.

Analyzing DU Logs: Immediately fails with "[LIBCONFIG] file .../du_case_140.conf - line 238: syntax error". Config module "libconfig" can't load, log_config section skipped, log init aborted. CMDLINE shows --rfsim --sa -O du_case_140.conf. DU never initializes beyond config parsing, no PHY/MAC setup, no rfsim server started. Crash point is config loading due to syntax error at line 238, likely from log_config=null.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars, sets up 8 RF cards for TDD at 3.6192GHz, creates threads for UE/L1_stats/RRC/NAS. Runs as rfsim client, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails (errno 111: Connection refused). No connection attempts succeed, UE loops on connect failures. This is because DU didn't start rfsim server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU config parsing fails due to log_config=null, causing syntax error in libconfig (null not valid for section). This prevents DU startup, so no rfsim server for UE (serveraddr mismatch: du_conf has "server", ue_conf has "127.0.0.1", but DU doesn't start anyway). CU starts but can't connect to DU via F1AP (remote_s_address="127.0.0.3" in cu_conf, but DU not running). Timeline: DU fails immediately on config load, UE fails to connect from start, CU proceeds but stalls on DU connection. Hypothesis: log_config=null violates libconfig syntax (expects object or valid value), based on OAI config patterns where log_config is an object with levels. No need for tools, as misconfigured_param directly indicates the issue.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change du_conf.log_config from null to a valid object, e.g., {"global_log_level":"info","hw_log_level":"info",...} matching cu_conf. This should allow DU to start, provide rfsim server, enable UE connection. Debug: Check libconfig syntax in conf file, ensure log_config is object. Further: Verify rfsimulator.serveraddr consistency ("server" vs "127.0.0.1"). Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... as is ...}, "du_conf": {... "log_config": {"global_log_level": "info", "hw_log_level": "info", "phy_log_level": "info", "mac_log_level": "info", "rlc_log_level": "info", "pdcp_log_level": "info", "rrc_log_level": "info", "ngap_log_level": "info", "f1ap_log_level": "info"} ...}, "ue_conf": {... as is ...}}.
