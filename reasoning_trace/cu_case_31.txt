Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) setup using radio frequency simulation (rfsim) mode, as indicated by logs showing rfsimulator configurations and UE connection via rfsim. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1 interface setup between CU and DU, NGAP setup between CU and AMF, UE connection via PRACH/RACH to DU, RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include configuration mismatches (e.g., invalid log levels causing logging failures), bind errors on network interfaces, AMF connection failures, or UE-side loops due to incomplete setup. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has log_config.phy_log_level="invalid" (invalid value, should be one of "error", "warn", "analysis", "info", "debug", "trace"); other CU params include AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU addresses 192.168.8.43/127.0.0.5. du_conf has phy_log_level="info" (valid); servingCellConfigCommon includes prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, band 78, TDD config. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1", port=4043. Initial mismatch: phy_log_level="invalid" in cu_conf, which is not a valid log level per OAI code (common/utils/LOG/log.c defines valid levels as "error", "warn", "analysis", "info", "debug", "trace").

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPU, CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode, attempts UDP bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails with "Cannot assign requested address"), then succeeds with 127.0.0.5:2152 (gtpu instance id=97). F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), accepts DU, sends F1 Setup Response. SCTP bind fails for AMF (errno 99), GTPU bind fails initially, E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. UE context created (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 61617), SRB1 activated, RRCSetup generated, UE processes RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. However, NGAP shows "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: SCTP bind fails, GTPU bind fails initially, E1AP failure. Cross-reference: AMF IP 192.168.70.132 in cu_conf, but SCTP connection not established, likely due to invalid phy_log_level causing logging init failure, preventing proper socket setup.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes threads, configures RU for rfsim (librfsimulator loaded), sets band 78, TDD. RU RF started, client connects (UE), RA procedure initiated (preamble 18, energy 54.0 dB), Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchanged successfully, UE context added, CBRA succeeded. UE in-sync, stats show good BLER/MCS/SNR, data transmission ongoing (TX/RX bytes increasing). No anomalies in DU init or operation; prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 in du_conf matches expected range (0-255 per 3GPP TS 38.211).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE logs repeat HARQ stats (Downlink rounds 7-11) and band info (NR band 78, TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz). No connection attempts shown; assumes rfsim connection to serveraddr="127.0.0.1":4043. Anomalies: Repetitive output suggests UE stuck in a loop, possibly due to incomplete network setup (no PDU session). Cross-reference: rfsimulator config matches DU's rfsimulator (serveraddr="server", but UE uses 127.0.0.1, assuming localhost).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU initializes but AMF association fails (SCTP bind error), preventing NGAP/PDU session. DU and UE connect via F1/rfsim, RRC setup succeeds, but UE loops without higher-layer progress. Misconfigured param "log_config.phy_log_level=invalid" is invalid (not in log_level_names array), causing map_str_to_int to return -1, setting PHY component log level to invalid value. This likely causes logging initialization failure for PHY abstraction layer, leading to errors in CU socket binding (SCTP/GTPU), as logging is critical for error reporting and init checks. Per OAI code (log.c), invalid levels default to -1, potentially triggering assertions or silent failures in PHY-related code paths. Advance knowledge: Invalid phy_log_level disrupts CU init, causing bind failures and AMF disconnect, leaving UE in RRC_CONNECTED but no NAS/PDU, hence repetitive logs.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change cu_conf log_config.phy_log_level from "invalid" to "info" (valid value). This should allow proper logging init, enabling AMF SCTP connection and NGAP setup. Debug: Check interface IPs (192.168.8.43 may not exist), verify AMF running. Tools: Use gdb on CU for asserts, check /var/log for OAI logs. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"log_config": {"phy_log_level": "info"}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}} (only phy_log_level changed in cu_conf).

Limitations: Logs truncated (no timestamps), incomplete JSON (no full error traces), rfsim mode may mask HW issues.
