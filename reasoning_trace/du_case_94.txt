Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads, GTPU/Ngap/F1AP setup), DU serving cell config parsing and MIB generation, rfsim server startup by DU, UE connection to rfsim server, PRACH/RACH procedure, RRC connection, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config parsing errors in fhi_72 config (e.g., invalid T1a_cp_dl timing causing front-haul issues), assertions in RU init, or network interface binding failures preventing proper inter-component communication. Parsing network_config: cu_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, GTPU address 192.168.8.43 (fails initially due to address issues, falls back to 127.0.0.5), F1AP ports 501/500. du_conf shows gNB-Eurecom-DU with fhi_72.fh_config[0].T1a_cp_dl=[0,429] (noted as potentially invalid zero first value), T1a_cp_ul=[285,429], Ta4=[110,180], ru_config iq_width=9. ue_conf shows IMSI=001010000000101, rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043. Initial mismatch: T1a_cp_dl[0]=0 in du_conf fhi_72 seems invalid compared to typical positive timing values.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates gNB_RRC_INST, sets up threads (SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, CU_F1), registers gNB with AMF, configures GTPU initially to 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails with "Cannot assign requested address" and bind failure, leading to "can't create GTP-U instance"), then retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 (succeeds, creates instance 97), starts F1AP at CU with SCTP socket to 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response, processes UE RRCSetupComplete, establishes RRC connection (UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED), but notes "No AMF is associated to the gNB" (expected in rfsim without AMF). No anomalies in CU beyond initial GTPU bind failure (likely due to network config mismatch), CU successfully handles DU and UE connections.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes, waits for gNB L1 instances, configures RU (rfsimulator), starts RF, connects UE client, processes RA procedure (initiates RA with preamble 3, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, schedules Msg3, receives Msg3 correctly, generates Msg4, receives Msg4 ACK, CBRA succeeds), adds UE MAC context, activates SRB1, ongoing data exchange with UE (frames 128 to 896, increasing TX/RX bytes, low BLER, good SNR). No errors or assertions, successful operation.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, configures PHY for TDD, connects to rfsim server, processes HARQ rounds (increasing from 8 to 11), band info (78 TDD), no connection failures, successful data exchange.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Components initialize successfully, F1 setup succeeds, UE connects to rfsim server, RA procedure completes successfully, RRC connection established, data exchange ongoing with good metrics (low BLER, high SNR). No crashes or assertions. Misconfigured T1a_cp_dl[0]=0 in du_conf fhi_72.fh_config[0] may be invalidâ€”per OAI fhi_72 config, T1a_cp_dl specifies timing for control plane downlink in front-haul split 7.2, but 0 might be invalid (e.g., minimum >0 for timing), causing front-haul timing issues. Network_config confirms T1a_cp_dl=[0,429] in du_conf fhi_72, but since RU starts successfully ("RU 0 rf device ready"), the issue may be performance degradation or timing violations. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid zero value violating OAI front-haul constraints.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf fhi_72.fh_config[0].T1a_cp_dl[0] from 0 to valid value like 285 (matching T1a_cp_ul[0]). Debug: Re-run with fixed config, check DU logs for front-haul timing warnings, verify performance metrics. Further analysis: Validate T1a_cp_dl against OAI fhi_72 documentation, check front-haul code for assertions. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {... "fhi_72": {"fh_config": [{"T1a_cp_dl": [285, 429], ...}], ...}, ...}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}.
