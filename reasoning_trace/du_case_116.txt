Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using --rfsim --sa options, where DU acts as rfsimulator server for UE radio emulation, CU handles control plane (NGAP/F1AP), and UE connects to rfsim server for PHY layer simulation. Expected flow: DU starts as rfsim server, CU initializes and binds to interfaces (e.g., 192.168.8.43 for GTPU/NGAP), establishes F1AP with DU, then UE connects to rfsim server (127.0.0.1:4043) for radio simulation, followed by PRACH/RRC/PDU session setup. Potential issues: Config validation failures (assertions on empty arrays) preventing DU startup, bind failures on CU interfaces, UE connection refused to rfsim server. network_config parsing: cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs with gNB_ID=0xe00, amf_ip_address=192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43, log_config with global_log_level="info" etc. du_conf has Active_gNBs=[] (empty array causing assertion), gNBs array with gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-DU", prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, rfsimulator with serveraddr="server" etc., log_config with global_log_level="info". ue_conf has rfsim=1, rfsimulator with serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Mismatch: Active_gNBs=[] in du_conf is invalid, unlike cu_conf's non-empty array.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC/PDCP instances, starts threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. NGAP registers gNB[0] with id 3584, checks AMF registration. SCTP bindx fails for 192.168.8.43 (errno 99: cannot assign requested address), GTPU bind fails for same address/port 2152, creating gtpu instance id=-1, failing CUUP N3 UDP listener. Then creates GTPU instance id=97 for 127.0.0.5:2152, starts F1AP at CU, accepts CU-UP ID 3584. Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest interface not available or already in use, but CU proceeds with local loopback (127.0.0.5) for F1AP/GTPU, waiting for DU connection. No direct link to misconfigured_param, but partial success indicates CU can init despite binds, but DU failure prevents full setup.

Analyzing DU Logs: Initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, RC.gNB set, but then assertion fails: "Assertion (num_gnbs > 0) failed!" in RCconfig_NR_L1() at gnb_config.c:800, "Failed to parse config file no gnbs Active_gNBs", "Exiting execution". Config loads successfully (libconfig_init returned 0), but validation asserts on empty Active_gNBs. Crash point: Assertion prevents any further DU execution, no rfsim server launched.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars for gNB TXant=1, UE RXant=1, configures 8 cards (0-7) with sample_rate=61440000, duplex_mode=TDD, freq=3619200000 Hz, gains set. Creates threads for UEthread/L1_UE_stats/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE. HW runs as client, loads RFSIMULATOR device, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail with errno(111): connection refused. No connection established, UE loops on connect attempts. Anomalies: Repeated failures indicate rfsim server not running (DU not started), UE can't proceed to PRACH/RRC.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU partially starts but bind failures don't halt it, proceeds with F1AP on loopback waiting for DU. DU loads config but asserts on empty Active_gNBs, crashing before starting rfsim server, so no server for UE. UE connect failures correlate with DU crash. Misconfigured_param "Active_gNBs=[]" in du_conf sets Active_gNBs to empty array, causing assertion num_gnbs > 0 to fail in gnb_config.c. In OAI, Active_gNBs must list active gNB names for DU to initialize; empty array triggers validation failure. Hypothesis: Active_gNBs=[] violates requirement for at least one active gNB, aborting DU init, preventing rfsim server, causing UE connect refused. CU proceeds but can't connect to DU, leading to stalled setup. No external tools needed; based on OAI code patterns where empty Active_gNBs causes assertion (seen in prior cases like gNBs=[]).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change Active_gNBs in du_conf from [] to ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], matching the gNB_name in gNBs array. This resolves assertion, allows DU startup as rfsim server, enables UE connection. Debug: Check gnb_config.c:800 for assertion, ensure Active_gNBs matches gNB names. Further: Ensure CU interface 192.168.8.43 is available or use loopback. Corrected network_config: cu_conf unchanged. du_conf: change "Active_gNBs": [] to "Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"]. ue_conf unchanged.
