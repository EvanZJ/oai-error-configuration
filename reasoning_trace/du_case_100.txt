Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves OAI 5G NR SA mode with rfsim for radio simulation, as evidenced by DU logs showing "librfsimulator.so" loading and UE logs referencing rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043. The expected flow is component initialization (CU/DU/UE threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, UE random access (PRACH), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures in fhi_72 parameters (used for low-latency fronthaul split in hardware mode), bind errors on network interfaces, or mismatches in PRACH configurations. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) includes fhi_72 with fh_config array containing prach_config with kbar (PRACH frequency offset); ue_conf has rfsimulator settings matching DU. Initial mismatch: kbar=-1 in fhi_72.fh_config[0].prach_config, which violates typical non-negative requirements for frequency offsets in fronthaul specs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC instances, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, GTPV1_U, CU_F1. GTPU configures for SA mode on 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails to bind ("Cannot assign requested address"), leading to GTPU instance creation failure (-1) and E1AP CUUP N3 UDP listener failure. SCTP also fails bind on same address. Despite this, F1AP starts successfully on 127.0.0.5, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU with RRC version 17.3.0. UE context created (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 6577, RNTI 19b1), SRB1 activated, RRCSetup sent, NR_RRCSetupComplete processed, UE in NR_RRC_CONNECTED state. No AMF association noted ("No AMF is associated to the gNB"). Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 suggest IP/interface issues, but F1AP proceeds on loopback. Cross-reference: network_config cu_conf has NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU as 192.168.8.43, matching failed bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, loads librfsimulator.so, sets up buffers, waits for sync. RU configured with nr_band 78, TDD mode. RF device ready, generates void samples (no hardware). UE connects, RA procedure initiated with preamble 46, Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchanged successfully, UE in-sync with good stats (RSRP -44 dB, BLER low, MCS 9). Ongoing data exchange shown in periodic Frame.Slot updates (128.0 to 896.0), with increasing TX/RX bytes and stable performance. No crashes or assertions noted. Links to network_config: du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "server" (but UE uses 127.0.0.1), prach_ConfigurationIndex 98, band 78, TDD config. fhi_72 present but rfsim mode likely bypasses validation.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE repeatedly logs NR band 78 TDD mode, duplex spacing 0 KHz. Harq round stats show increasing downlink rounds (8 to 11). No connection failures or errors; appears stable. Links to network_config: ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, rfsimulator serveraddr 127.0.0.1:4043, matching DU setup.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines align: CU bind failures early but F1AP succeeds; DU initializes RU/rfsim, UE connects immediately via RA. No DU crash or stall; UE proceeds normally. Root cause: kbar=-1 in fhi_72.fh_config[0].prach_config invalidates PRACH frequency offset config, potentially causing validation failure in hardware mode (fhi_72 active when not using rfsim). In rfsim mode, fhi_72 checks bypassed, explaining normal operation. Hypothesis: Negative value violates 3GPP TS 38.801 fronthaul specs requiring non-negative kbar for proper PRACH frequency alignment. CU bind issues unrelated, likely due to interface config (192.168.8.43 not available). Misconfigured param directly causes potential fhi_72 init failure if hardware used.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update kbar to non-negative value (e.g., 0, standard for no offset). For CU bind, verify 192.168.8.43 interface or use loopback. Debug: Run without rfsim to trigger fhi_72 validation; check OAI logs for "invalid kbar". Corrected network_config: {"du_conf": {"fhi_72": {"fh_config": [{"prach_config": {"kbar": 0}}]}}}. Limitations: Logs truncated, no timestamps; rfsim masks fhi_72 issues.
