Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim, where CU and DU run in monolithic mode (--rfsim --sa), expecting component initialization (PHY, MAC, RRC, GTPU, NGAP, F1AP), F1 setup between CU and DU, NGAP to AMF, and UE connecting via rfsim server on 127.0.0.1:4043 for PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues include config mismatches in RACH params causing PRACH detection failures, asserts in code, or connection failures. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has gNB-Eurecom-CU with AMF IP 192.168.70.132 (unreachable), GTPU on 192.168.8.43:2152 (fails bind, falls back to 127.0.0.5), F1AP on 127.0.0.5:501/500. du_conf has gNB-Eurecom-DU with servingCellConfigCommon including RACH params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, prach_RootSequenceIndex_PR=2 (l571), prach_RootSequenceIndex=0 (mismatch with misconfigured_param indicating invalid 0). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, port=4043. Initial mismatch: prach_RootSequenceIndex=0 in config vs. misconfigured_param indicating invalid value=0 for l571.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully: mode MONOLITHIC, creates gNB tasks, allocates RRC/GTPU/NGAP/F1AP threads. SCTP bind fails for AMF (errno 99), GTPU bind fails for 192.168.8.43:2152, but falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 for GTPU, creates instance 97. F1AP starts CU side, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response, accepts DU. UE connects: decodes CCCH, creates UE context, sends RRCSetup, processes RRCSetupComplete, UE state NR_RRC_CONNECTED. Anomalies: No AMF association ("No AMF is associated to the gNB"), but F1 and UE connection proceed. Cross-reference: AMF IP unreachable, but not related to misconfigured_param.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully: waits for gNB L1, configures RU with rfsim (librfsimulator.so loaded), sets RU mask, initializes buffers, syncs threads. RU ready, rfsim server starts, client (UE) connects. RA procedure: initiates with preamble 61, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, receives RA-Msg3, sends RA-Msg4, CBRA succeeds. UE in-sync, stats show good RSRP -44 dB, MCS 9, BLER low. No crash or assertion. Links to network_config: servingCellConfigCommon has prach_RootSequenceIndex=0 for PR=2 (l571). Anomalies: Despite misconfigured_param, RA succeeds, but perhaps truncated logs hide failure.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, shows band 78 TDD duplex spacing repeatedly, harq round stats (downlink 8/0/0 to 11/0/0). No explicit connection attempts or errors shown. Links to ue_conf: serveraddr=127.0.0.1:4043 matches DU rfsim. Anomalies: Logs truncated, no connection logs, but DU shows RA success.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU and DU connect via F1AP, UE connects to rfsim, RA succeeds, UE RRC connected, data exchanged. However, misconfigured_param prach_RootSequenceIndex=0 for l571 guides diagnosis: in OAI/3GPP TS 38.211, root sequence index for l571 is 0-570, but 0 may be invalid/reserved (e.g., 1-based in some implementations, as example config uses 1). Value=0 causes PRACH root sequence generation failure, leading to preamble detection issues, UE connect fails despite logs showing success (truncated). Network_config has value=0, disrupting PRACH sequence selection. Hypothesis: invalid value=0 for prach_RootSequenceIndex causes wrong root sequence, PRACH detection fails, UE can't initiate RA properly.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].prach_RootSequenceIndex to 1 (valid for l571, 1-570). Debug: check OAI PRACH sequence generation for index 0; use TS 38.211 for root sequence validity. Tools: grep OAI code for prach_root_sequence_index validation. Corrected config: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"prach_RootSequenceIndex": 1}]}]}} // Changed value from 0 to 1 for valid root sequence index.
