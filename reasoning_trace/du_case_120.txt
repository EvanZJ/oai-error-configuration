Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim (--rfsim --sa options), where CU, DU, and UE run separately. Expected flow: CU initializes NGAP/GTPU/F1AP, DU initializes L1/PHY/MAC and starts rfsimulator server, UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, then proceeds to PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: config parsing failures (e.g., empty arrays causing assertions), bind failures (e.g., IP/port mismatches), connection timeouts. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs with AMF IP 192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES with 192.168.8.43 for NGU/S1U. du_conf has Active_gNBs=[], gNBs array with one gNB "gNB-Eurecom-DU", MACRLCs/L1s/RUs configured, rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (should be "127.0.0.1"?), fhi_72 with valid timing/IQ params. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport=4043. Mismatch: du_conf Active_gNBs=[] (empty, causing num_gnbs=0 assertion), rfsimulator serveraddr="server" vs UE's "127.0.0.1".

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, creates threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU. NGAP registers gNB[0] id 3584, checks AMF registration. GTPU configures SA mode, binds to 192.168.8.43:2152 but "bind: Cannot assign requested address" (IP not available?), fails to create GTP-U instance. E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. SCTP bindx fails with errno 99 (address not available). F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5:2152, succeeds with gtpu id 97. Anomalies: Bind failures on 192.168.8.43 (network interface issue?), but F1AP proceeds. No AMF connection shown, likely due to DU not starting.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts MONOLITHIC, initializes RC.gNB, but immediately "Assertion (num_gnbs > 0) failed!" in RCconfig_NR_L1() gnb_config.c:800. "Failed to parse config file no gnbs Active_gNBs", exits execution. CMDLINE shows -O du_case_120.conf. Config loads libconfig, sets parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst=0, nb_nr_L1_inst=1, nb_ru=1. Crash point: Assertion on num_gnbs > 0, indicating Active_gNBs array is empty, so no gNBs to configure.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars for TDD, configures 8 cards (nb_tx=4, nb_rx=4 from RU config), sets frequencies/gains. Creates threads for UEthread/L1_UE_stats/TASK_RRC_NRUE/TASK_NAS_NRUE. Runs as rfsim client, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail with errno(111) "Connection refused". No successful connection, so UE hangs in connect loop.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crashes immediately due to empty Active_gNBs in du_conf, preventing L1/PHY init and rfsim server startup. UE can't connect to rfsim server (DU not running). CU has bind issues on 192.168.8.43 (possibly network config), but primary failure is DU assertion. Misconfigured_param "Active_gNBs=[]" directly causes num_gnbs=0 assertion in gnb_config.c, as Active_gNBs must list active gNB names from gNBs array. In OAI, this array validates config structure; empty means no gNBs to activate. Hypothesis: Empty Active_gNBs violates structural requirement, causing parse failure/assertion, DU exit before rfsim server starts, UE connect fails. CU bind issues secondary, possibly due to missing DU.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix du_conf Active_gNBs to ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"] to match gNBs[0].gNB_name. Also, rfsimulator.serveraddr in du_conf is "server", should be "127.0.0.1" to match UE. Debug: Check network interfaces for 192.168.8.43 availability. Tools: Run with gdb on DU to confirm assertion. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... unchanged ...}, "du_conf": {"Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], ... "rfsimulator": {"serveraddr": "127.0.0.1", ...}}, "ue_conf": {... unchanged ...}}.
