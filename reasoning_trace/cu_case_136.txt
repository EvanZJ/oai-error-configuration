Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in CU CMDLINE and UE logs showing rfsimulator server connection attempts. The expected flow is: CU initializes with config loading, starts NGAP for AMF association, DU initializes and connects to CU via F1AP, UE connects to rfsim server for PHY simulation, then proceeds to PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session. Potential issues include config syntax errors causing early CU failure, preventing DU F1AP connection and UE rfsim link. Parsing network_config: cu_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-CU"], gNBs with gNB_ID=0xe00, local_s_address=127.0.0.5, amf_ip_address ipv4=192.168.70.132, NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=192.168.8.43, security with ciphering_algorithms=["nea3","nea2","nea1","nea0"], integrity_algorithms=["nia2","nia0"], and log_config={} (empty object, matching misconfigured_param). du_conf has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, local_n_address=127.0.0.3, rfsimulator serveraddr="server", log_config with global_log_level="info" etc. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: cu_conf log_config={} is empty, unlike du_conf's populated log_config, which will cause libconfig parse failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts with libconfig parsing, but hits syntax error at line 81 in cu_case_136.conf: "syntax error". This prevents config module loading ("config module "libconfig" couldn't be loaded"), skips log_config section ("config_get, section log_config skipped, config module not properly initialized"), aborts init ("init aborted, configuration couldn't be performed"), and fails overall ("Getting configuration failed"). CMDLINE shows --rfsim --sa mode. config_libconfig_init returns -1 (failure). Log init proceeds with defaults ("log init done"), and command-line options are read, but no further init occurs due to config failure. Anomalies: Incomplete logs, no AMF/NGAP setup, no F1AP start, indicating early abort before network interfaces or threads.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU loads config successfully ("config_libconfig_init returned 0", "config module libconfig loaded"), sets parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst=1 etc. Initializes northbound interface, sets DL/UL frequency 3619200000, configures F1 interfaces for MACRLC. Creates threads: TASK_SCTP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_GTPV1_U, TASK_DU_F1. Starts F1AP at DU, binds to 127.0.0.3, connects to CU at 127.0.0.5. Initializes GTPU UDP on 127.0.0.3:2152. But SCTP connect fails repeatedly ("Connect failed: Connection refused"), retries F1AP association. Initializes PHY, RU, waits for F1 Setup Response ("waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio"). No crash, but stuck in retry loop due to CU not responding.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars, sets TXant=1 RXant=1, frequency 3619200000, configures HW cards 0-7 for TDD, gains. Creates threads: UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE. Runs as rfsim client ("Running as client: will connect to a rfsimulator server side"), loads RFSIMULATOR device. Tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, but fails with errno(111) "Connection refused". No successful connection, so no PRACH or RRC attempts.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU fails early due to libconfig syntax error in log_config={}, preventing config load and init, so CU doesn't start NGAP/AMF or F1AP server. DU initializes but can't connect to CU via SCTP/F1AP (connection refused), retries indefinitely. UE can't connect to rfsim server (DU's rfsimulator serveraddr="server" but UE uses 127.0.0.1, mismatch? Wait, UE uses 127.0.0.1:4043, DU has serveraddr="server" which might resolve to localhost, but since DU isn't fully up due to F1 failure, server not started). Timeline: CU aborts at config load, DU starts but waits for F1, UE waits for rfsim. Hypothesis: Empty log_config={} causes syntax error in libconfig (empty objects invalid in libconfig format), leading to config_load_configmodule.c failure, aborting CU init. This prevents CU from binding sockets or starting services, causing DU SCTP failures and UE connect failures. Guided by misconfigured_param "log_config={}", this is a known invalid config causing libconfig parse error (libconfig expects key-value pairs, not empty {}). No need for tools, as logs directly show syntax error and config load failure.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix by populating log_config in cu_conf with valid levels, e.g., matching du_conf: global_log_level="info", hw_log_level="info", phy_log_level="info", mac_log_level="info". Debug: Check cu_case_136.conf syntax with libconfig tools, ensure log_config has required fields. Tools: Use grep in OAI code for log_config validation. Corrected configs: cu_conf log_config={"global_log_level":"info","hw_log_level":"info","phy_log_level":"info","mac_log_level":"info"}; du_conf unchanged; ue_conf unchanged.

Limitations: CU logs truncated after command-line read, no full error stack; DU/UE logs show retries but no timeouts; network_config lacks full gnb.conf/ue.conf paths, assumes cu_case_136.conf has log_config={}. Base on OAI config_userapi.c exits on libconfig errors, 3GPP specs not directly relevant here.
