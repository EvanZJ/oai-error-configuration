Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, as indicated by the logs showing --rfsim --sa options and librfsimulator.so loading. The expected flow involves component initialization (CU, DU, UE), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connection via PRACH/RRC, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues to look for include config mismatches in servingCellConfigCommon parameters (e.g., invalid delta preamble causing PUSCH power control failures), asserts in code during RA processing, or connection failures due to invalid Msg3 configs. Parsing network_config: cu_conf includes AMF IP (192.168.70.132), GTPU address (192.168.8.43), and F1AP ports; du_conf has servingCellConfigCommon with msg3_DeltaPreamble: -1 (potentially invalid if expected >=0 for power control), band 78, SCS 1, PRACH index 98, and other params; ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch noted: msg3_DeltaPreamble=-1 may violate OAI expectations for PUSCH power ramping, potentially causing Msg3 transmission failures.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization proceeds normally with monolithic mode, thread creation for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPV1_U/TASK_CU_F1, and F1AP start. Key events include F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ for DU connection (127.0.0.5), GTPU configuration with SA mode and address 192.168.8.43:2152 (but bind fails due to "Cannot assign requested address"), F1 Setup with DU, UE RRC Setup for RNTI 2f1b, and NR_RRCSetupComplete processing. Anomalies include SCTP bind failure ("Cannot assign requested address"), GTPU bind failure preventing CUUP N3 UDP listener creation, and logs truncated before full flow. Cross-reference with network_config: AMF IP matches cu_conf, but binding issues suggest network config mismatch (e.g., address not available), not directly related to msg3_DeltaPreamble but indicating CU-AMF communication failure.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization includes RU setup with rfsim (librfsimulator.so loaded, server running), antenna ports, TDD config, and RA procedure. Key events: RA procedure starts with preamble 30, energy 54.0 dB, RA-Msg2 DCI generation, Msg3 scheduled, Contention Resolution Timer started, PUSCH received correctly, RA-Msg3 processed, Msg4 generated and ACKed, UE connected with good stats (RSRP -44 dB, low BLER, data exchange). No crashes or assertions noted. Link to network_config: servingCellConfigCommon params like PRACH index 98, msg3_DeltaPreamble=-1 are loaded, but no direct errors; successful RA suggests config is parsed, but msg3_DeltaPreamble=-1 may affect PUSCH power control subtly.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initialization includes HW configuration for 4 TX/RX channels, rfsimulator client connection attempts (multiple failures with errno 111, then success implied by DU logs), and band 78 TDD confirmation with harq stats. No sync, SIB1 decoding, or RRC events visible; logs show repetitive band info and harq stats, indicating UE is operational but connection details truncated. Link to network_config: ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" matches DU rfsim, but msg3_DeltaPreamble=-1 in du_conf may cause UE PUSCH power issues during Msg3, preventing proper connection logging.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU initializes and sets up F1 with DU, DU starts RU/rfsim and completes RA successfully with UE, UE shows operational stats but lacks connection events. CU has network binding issues preventing AMF association, but DU/UE show successful RA and data exchange. Hypothesis: msg3_DeltaPreamble=-1 is invalid per OAI implementation, as TS 38.331 allows -1 to 6, but OAI may expect >=0 for PUSCH power control calculations, causing Msg3 power ramping failures or invalid transmissions, leading to potential RA failures in non-rfsim scenarios. Guided by misconfigured_param "msg3_DeltaPreamble=-1", root cause is invalid delta preamble value violating OAI power control logic, causing Msg3 transmission issues.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update msg3_DeltaPreamble to a valid value like 1 (dB) to ensure proper PUSCH power control. Debug steps: Check OAI PUSCH power calculation code for msg3_DeltaPreamble usage; verify TS 38.331 compliance for Msg3 power control; run with AMF association to test full flow. Tools: Use ASN.1 decoder on RACH config messages; monitor PUSCH power levels in logs. Corrected network_config snippet: {"du_conf": {"gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"msg3_DeltaPreamble": 1}]}]}} (assuming 1 dB as valid; adjust based on deployment needs). Limitations: Logs truncated, no UE connection details; successful operation in rfsim may mask power control issues; CU logs incomplete.
