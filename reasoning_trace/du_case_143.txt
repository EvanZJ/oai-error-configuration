Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation. The expected flow is: DU initializes with config, starts rfsim server; CU initializes, connects to AMF via NGAP and to DU via F1AP; UE connects to rfsim server for radio simulation, performs PRACH, RRC setup, and PDU session. Potential issues include invalid PRACH config params causing root sequence computation failures, asserts in MAC code, connection failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has Active_gNBs=["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], gNBs array with servingCellConfigCommon including prach_ConfigurationIndex=256, SCTP settings, MACRLCs/L1s/RUs arrays, rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"server","serverport":4043}, log_config object, fhi_72 with fh_config. ue_conf has rfsimulator={"serveraddr":"127.0.0.1","serverport":"4043"}, imsi, etc. Initial mismatch: prach_ConfigurationIndex=256 in du_conf.servingCellConfigCommon[0] likely invalid, as 3GPP TS 38.211 defines prach-ConfigurationIndex as 0-255.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, initializes PHY/L1/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, sets up threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/GTPU. GTPU tries to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), falls back to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. NGAP registers gNB, checks AMF state. F1AP starts at CU, creates socket for 127.0.0.5. CU proceeds to wait for DU connection.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU starts, initializes PHY/MAC/RRC, configures serving cell with physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, prach_ConfigurationIndex=256. Sets up TDD config, MIB, frame params. Then hits assertion: "Assertion (r > 0) failed!" in compute_nr_root_seq() at nr_mac_common.c:2002, "bad r: L_ra 139, NCS 167". Exits execution. Crash point is root sequence computation failure during PRACH config, preventing further init and rfsim server start.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY vars, sets up 8 RF cards for TDD at 3.6192GHz, creates threads for UE/L1_stats/RRC/NAS. Runs as rfsim client, tries to connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails (errno 111: Connection refused). No connection attempts succeed, UE loops on connect failures. This is because DU crashed before starting rfsim server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crashes on PRACH root sequence computation due to invalid prach_ConfigurationIndex=256, causing assertion failure in compute_nr_root_seq. UE fails to connect from start. CU starts but can't connect to DU via F1AP (remote_s_address="127.0.0.3" in cu_conf, but DU not running). Timeline: DU fails on PRACH config, UE fails to connect immediately, CU proceeds but stalls on DU connection. Hypothesis: prach_ConfigurationIndex=256 violates 3GPP TS 38.211 range (0-255), causing invalid L_ra/NCS in root sequence calc, triggering assert in compute_nr_root_seq. No need for tools, as misconfigured_param directly indicates the issue.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change du_conf.gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].prach_ConfigurationIndex from 256 to a valid value like 98. This should allow PRACH root sequence computation, DU to start, provide rfsim server, enable UE connection. Debug: Check PRACH config logs, validate index against TS 38.211. Further: Verify rfsimulator.serveraddr consistency ("server" vs "127.0.0.1"). Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {... as is ...}, "du_conf": {... "gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"prach_ConfigurationIndex": 98, ...}]}] ...}, "ue_conf": {... as is ...}}.
