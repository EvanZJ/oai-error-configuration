Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) mode deployment using radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for testing. The setup consists of three main components: CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment). Expected flow involves: component initialization → F1 interface setup between CU and DU → NGAP setup with AMF → UE random access (PRACH) → RRC connection → PDU session establishment. Key potential issues to look for include configuration parsing failures from invalid IP addresses, network interface binding failures, and protocol handshake errors. The network_config shows cu_conf with invalid AMF IP address "192.168.1.256" (invalid octet 256, should be 0-255), du_conf with valid configuration, and ue_conf with rfsimulator settings. Initial analysis shows amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.1.256" as a clear configuration error since IPv4 octets must be in range 0-255.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization fails completely with critical configuration errors: libconfig syntax error at line 91 of cu_case_04.conf, config module couldn't be loaded, log initialization aborted, and "Getting configuration failed". The CU cannot proceed beyond basic command-line parsing, with no thread creation, network interface setup, or protocol initialization occurring. This indicates a fundamental configuration parsing failure that prevents any CU functionality.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization appears successful with proper configuration loading ("config module libconfig loaded"), thread creation (TASK_SCTP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_GTPV1_U, TASK_DU_F1), and F1AP setup attempts. However, repeated SCTP connection failures occur: "Connect failed: Connection refused" with unsuccessful SCTP association results, causing continuous retry attempts. The DU waits for F1 Setup Response before activating radio ("waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio"), indicating dependency on CU availability. No UE-related activity occurs due to the F1 connection failure.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initialization shows hardware configuration for 8 cards with rfsimulator settings, thread creation (UEthread, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE), and UICC simulation setup. However, repeated rfsimulator connection failures occur: "connect() to 127.0.0.1:4043 failed, errno(111)" (Connection refused), with continuous retry attempts. The UE cannot establish connection to the rfsimulator server because the DU is not properly running the rfsimulator service.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The gNBs.amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.1.256" configuration in cu_conf is the root cause. This invalid IPv4 address (octet 256 exceeds maximum value 255) causes libconfig syntax error during CU configuration parsing, completely preventing CU initialization. The CU configuration failure cascades through the system: DU cannot establish F1 connection to CU ("Connection refused"), UE cannot connect to rfsimulator server because DU is not running properly. Timeline correlation shows complete CU failure preventing DU initialization completion and UE connectivity. The invalid IP address syntax error halts the entire OAI deployment initialization sequence.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change amf_ip_address.ipv4 from invalid "192.168.1.256" to a valid IPv4 address (e.g., "192.168.70.132" or another accessible AMF IP). Verify configuration file syntax is valid before deployment. Test with corrected configuration to ensure CU initializes properly and F1/DU-UE connections succeed. Monitor configuration parsing logs during startup. If issues persist, validate all IP addresses in configuration files.

Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "gNBs": {
      "amf_ip_address": {
        "ipv4": "192.168.70.132"  // Changed from invalid "192.168.1.256" to valid IPv4 address
      }
    }
  }
}
