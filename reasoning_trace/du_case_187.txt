Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with monolithic mode (CU/DU combined). The expected flow is: component initialization (PHY/MAC/RRC threads), F1AP setup between CU and DU, NGAP connection to AMF, rfsim server startup for UE connection, PRACH/RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config validation failures in servingCellConfigCommon (e.g., invalid RACH target power values causing ASN.1 encoding failures in RACH config cloning), GTPU binding errors (address conflicts), or rfsim server not starting due to DU crashes. Network_config shows gnb_conf (du_conf) with servingCellConfigCommon having dl_frequencyBand=78 (valid), physCellId=0, absoluteFrequencySSB=641280, dl_absoluteFrequencyPointA=640008, preambleReceivedTargetPower=200 (invalid, must be negative dBm), dl_carrierBandwidth=106, ul_frequencyBand=78. Ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr=127.0.0.1, serverport=4043. Initial mismatch: preambleReceivedTargetPower=200 violates RACH power range, likely causing DU crash during RACH config cloning.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes successfully with monolithic mode, creates threads for SCTP/NGAP/GNB_APP/RRC_GNB/CU_F1/GTPV1_U. Registers gNB[0] with macro id 3584, checks AMF registration. GTPU configures SA mode but fails to bind to 192.168.8.43:2152 (address not assignable), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 and succeeds (instance id 97). No F1AP setup shown yet, as DU crashes before connection.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes with monolithic mode, creates gNB tasks, sets antenna ports (pdsch_AntennaPorts N1 2 N2 1 XP 2, pusch_AntennaPorts 4), minTXRXTIME 6, SIB1 TDA 15, MIMO layers 1. Reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78, ABSFREQPOINTA 640008, DLBW 106, RACH_TargetReceivedPower 200). Processes band 78 (TDD, duplex spacing 0 KHz), converts SSB to 3619200000 Hz. Configures MAC common params, DL_Bandwidth:40, sets TDD period to 6, configures MIB (Nid_cell 0, DL freq 3619200000, UL freq 3619200000), initializes frame params for mu 1, N_RB 106. Then hits assertion: "Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed! In clone_rach_configcommon() ... could not clone NR_RACH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding". This crashes DU in nr_rrc_config.c:68 during RACH config cloning. Config shows parallel_conf=2, worker_conf=1, nb_rrc_inst 1, nb_nr_L1_inst 1, nb_ru 1. Crash prevents rfsim server startup.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes with rfsim client mode, configures 8 cards/channels for TDD, creates threads. Loads RFSIMULATOR device, tries connecting to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly (errno 111 - connection refused). No successful connections, as rfsim server isn't running due to DU crash. UICC sim with IMSI=001010000000101, DNN=oai.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: DU crash at RACH config cloning prevents F1AP connection to CU (CU shows no DU acceptance), stopping rfsim server startup, causing UE connect failures. Misconfigured preambleReceivedTargetPower=200 triggers ASN.1 encoding failure in clone_rach_configcommon() (nr_rrc_config.c:68), as RACH target power must be negative dBm (e.g., -120 to -40 per TS 38.331). Valid range is negative values in dBm. This invalid positive value causes RACH_ConfigCommon encoding to fail with buffer overflow, leading to immediate DU exit during config cloning. CU proceeds but stalls without DU. UE can't connect as server isn't listening. Hypothesis: preambleReceivedTargetPower=200 violates RACH power constraints, leading to ASN.1 encoding assert in RACH config cloning. No external tools needed, as misconfigured_param directly indicates invalid RACH power.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update preambleReceivedTargetPower to valid negative dBm value (e.g., -96). Debug by checking nr_rrc_config.c clone_rach_configcommon() for ASN.1 encoding validation. Run with corrected config, verify DU starts rfsim server, UE connects. Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": { ... (unchanged) },
  "du_conf": {
    ... (unchanged except servingCellConfigCommon[0].preambleReceivedTargetPower: -96)
  },
  "ue_conf": { ... (unchanged) }
}
Explanation: Changed preambleReceivedTargetPower from 200 to -96 (valid negative dBm value for RACH target power per TS 38.331).
