Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) mode deployment using radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for testing. The setup consists of three main components: CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment). Expected flow involves: component initialization → F1 interface setup between CU and DU → NGAP setup with AMF → UE random access (PRACH) → RRC connection → PDU session establishment. Key potential issues to look for include ASN.1 encoding/decoding problems from invalid verbosity settings, network interface binding failures, and protocol handshake errors. The network_config shows cu_conf with invalid Asn1_verbosity=123 (should be string), du_conf with valid "annoying" verbosity, and ue_conf with rfsimulator settings. Initial analysis shows Asn1_verbosity=123 as a clear configuration error since this parameter expects string values like "none", "info", "annoying".

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initialization shows successful thread creation for TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1, and TASK_GTPV1_U. However, critical failures occur: SCTP bindx fails with "Cannot assign requested address" (errno 99), GTPU initialization fails with bind error for address 192.168.8.43:2152, resulting in "can't create GTP-U instance" and "Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener". Despite these failures, F1AP setup succeeds with DU connection (assoc_id 6), UE context creation (CU UE ID 1, DU UE ID 42981), and RRC setup completion. The CU reaches NR_RRC_CONNECTED state but shows "No AMF is associated to the gNB", indicating NGAP connection failure. Cross-referencing with network_config, the cu_conf shows NETWORK_INTERFACES with GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU both set to 192.168.8.43, which matches the failed GTPU bind address.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initialization is successful with RU (Radio Unit) configuration using librfsimulator.so, proper antenna setup (4x4 MIMO), and TDD configuration for band 78. Random access procedure completes successfully: PRACH detection at frame 183.19, RA-Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 exchange, and contention resolution. UE achieves stable connection with good signal metrics (RSRP -44 dB, SNR 57.0 dB, BLER decreasing over time). Statistics show normal UL/DL traffic with increasing frame counts (256.0, 384.0, 512.0, etc.) and stable MCS 9. No PHY/MAC errors or assertions are present. The DU appears fully functional and can communicate with both CU (via F1) and UE (via rfsim).

Analyzing UE Logs: UE shows repetitive band 78 TDD configuration confirmations and Harq round statistics progressing from 7/0/0 to 11/0/0 downlink rounds, indicating active communication. No connection failures or errors are evident - the UE appears to be successfully connected and exchanging data with the network via rfsimulator. The ue_conf shows proper rfsimulator configuration with serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043", matching the DU's rfsimulator settings.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: The Asn1_verbosity=123 configuration in cu_conf is the root cause. This invalid integer value (instead of expected string like "none", "info", "annoying") causes ASN.1 encoding/decoding failures in the CU's protocol message processing. The SCTP and GTPU binding failures (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address") are symptoms of ASN.1 message corruption preventing proper socket initialization and AMF association. Timeline correlation shows CU initialization partially succeeds (F1AP works), but network-facing services fail, while DU and UE operate normally. The DU-UE communication succeeds because it bypasses the CU's corrupted ASN.1 processing via direct F1 interface. This explains why RRC connection works but AMF association fails - the CU can handle F1 signaling but cannot establish external network connections due to ASN.1 encoding issues.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change Asn1_verbosity from 123 to a valid string value (e.g., "none", "info", or "annoying") in cu_conf. Verify ASN.1 message encoding/decoding works properly after the fix. Test with corrected configuration to ensure SCTP/GTPU binding succeeds. Monitor protocol message logs and ASN.1 encoding errors during initialization. If issues persist, check for ASN.1 library compatibility or version conflicts.

Corrected network_config:
{
  "cu_conf": {
    "Asn1_verbosity": "none"  // Changed from invalid integer 123 to valid string
  }
}
