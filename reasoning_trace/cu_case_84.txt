Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by GTPU SA mode and UE rfsim client connection. Expected flow: CU initializes, binds GTPU/NGAP interfaces, connects to AMF via NGAP, sets up F1AP to DU, DU activates radio/rfsim server, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Invalid local_s_if_name causing SCTP binding failures, AMF connection issues, but F1AP/rfsim may work. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has local_s_if_name="invalid_interface" (string instead of valid interface like "lo"), which matches misconfigured_param "gNBs.local_s_if_name=invalid_interface". du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (mismatch with UE's 127.0.0.1). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch: Invalid local_s_if_name likely causes SCTP bind failure.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads, starts F1AP at CU, binds GTPU to 192.168.8.43:2152 but fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), retries with 127.0.0.5:2152 succeeds. SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 ("Cannot assign requested address"), but proceeds with 127.0.0.5. F1AP SCTP succeeds, receives F1 Setup Request from DU, sends Response, UE RRC setup succeeds (NR_RRC_CONNECTED). But "[NGAP] No AMF is associated to the gNB" – no AMF connection. Anomalous: GTPU/SCTP bind fail on 192.168.8.43 (invalid IP?), but F1AP proceeds; NGAP stalls without AMF IP. local_s_if_name="invalid_interface" may cause SCTP issues, but CU proceeds.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes fully: loads RU (librfsimulator), sets band 78, starts rfsim server, waits for UE connect. UE connects, RA procedure initiates (preamble 56), Msg2/Msg3/Msg4 succeed, UE in-sync with RSRP -44 dB, data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing). No PHY/MAC errors; rfsim generates samples, HARQ rounds increase. Links to network_config: prach_ConfigurationIndex=98 valid per TS 38.211.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE connects to rfsim server (127.0.0.1:4043), band 78 TDD confirmed, HARQ stats show successful DL reception (rounds 8-11/0/0). No connection failures; in-sync, data flowing. Links to ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1".

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU GTPU/SCTP bind fails on 192.168.8.43 (invalid address?), but succeeds on 127.0.0.5 for F1AP. F1AP setup succeeds, DU activates rfsim, UE connects/PRACH succeeds. But NGAP has "No AMF associated" because amf_ip_address IP invalid or local_s_if_name="invalid_interface" causes SCTP bind failure. Timeline: CU init partial (binding fails but F1AP ok) → DU waits F1 Setup (succeeds) → UE connects rfsim (succeeds) → but no AMF → no PDU session. Hypothesis: local_s_if_name="invalid_interface" invalid interface name causes SCTP binding failures for NGAP, preventing AMF association. Per OAI code, local_s_if_name must be valid interface (e.g., "lo"); invalid value causes runtime bind issues. Guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.local_s_if_name=invalid_interface", root cause is invalid interface name causing SCTP/NGAP binding failure, preventing AMF connection.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set local_s_if_name to valid interface, e.g., "lo". Also fix du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr to "127.0.0.1". Debug: Check interface names with 'ip link'; validate SCTP bind. Tools: Use grep_search on OAI for local_s_if_name usage. Corrected configs:
