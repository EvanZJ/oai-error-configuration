Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This scenario involves OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR Standalone (SA) mode with radio frequency simulation (rfsim), utilizing a CU-DU split architecture where CU and DU run as separate processes (nr-softmodem instances), and UE simulated via rfsim client connecting to the DU's rfsimulator server. Expected flow: CU initializes, loads configuration (including remote south address for F1), starts GTPU (N3), NGAP, and F1AP servers; DU initializes, establishes F1AP SCTP connection to CU, waits for F1 Setup Response, then activates radio and starts rfsimulator server; UE initializes, connects to rfsimulator server for PHY simulation, performs PRACH/RRC/NGAP procedures for PDU session setup. Potential issues: Config parameter validation failures (e.g., empty remote addresses causing connection skips), IP address unavailability (errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address"), SCTP/UDP bind failures preventing protocol setup, AMF association failures, F1AP setup stalls, rfsim server not starting (preventing UE connect). Network_config parsed: cu_conf includes gNBs with remote_s_address="" (empty string; invalid, should be "127.0.0.3" for DU), local_s_address="127.0.0.5", local_s_portc=501 (F1-C port), NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43" (may not be local). du_conf includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="server" (invalid). ue_conf includes rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Key mismatches: remote_s_address="" invalid; IPs "192.168.8.43" not local; du_conf "server" vs. ue_conf "127.0.0.1". Guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.remote_s_address=", hypothesize empty remote address causes F1AP connection failure, preventing F1 setup and radio activation.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in monolithic mode, creates threads (TASK_SCTP, TASK_NGAP, TASK_GNB_APP, TASK_RRC_GNB, TASK_CU_F1), registers gNB[0] with NGAP, checks AMF state. GTPU configures for SA mode, address "192.168.8.43", port 2152, but bind fails ("bind: Cannot assign requested address"), can't create GTP-U instance, fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. SCTP bind fails ("sctp_bindx() SCTP_BINDX_ADD_ADDR failed: errno 99 Cannot assign requested address"), no SCTP connection established. F1AP starts at CU, attempts "F1AP_CU_SCTP_REQ(create socket) for 127.0.0.5 len 10", but no F1 Setup Request received. Anomalies: No F1AP connection to DU despite DU running; logs end without F1 setup. Cross-reference: cu_conf remote_s_address="" invalid (empty string causes F1AP to skip connection to DU), preventing F1AP association.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RUs, PHY, threads, starts F1AP at DU, waits for F1 Setup Response. PHY detects RA preamble, initiates RA procedure, UE RA-RNTI, DCI, Msg3, Msg4, UE context added, RRC setup, UE connected. UE stats show successful DL/UL, MAC TX/RX bytes. No crashes; DU operates normally post-radio activation. Cross-reference: du_conf MACRLCs remote_n_address="127.0.0.5" valid, but CU not connecting.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes NR band/duplex (TDD), Harq stats (DL rounds 8-11), no errors. No RRC/PRACH attempts in logs; assumes successful connect as DU shows UE activity. Cross-reference: ue_conf rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches DU server.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines correlate: CU GTPU/NGAP binds fail (IP issues), F1AP starts but no connection (empty remote_s_address), DU activates radio/rfsim, UE connects, but no F1 setup, no AMF association. DU/UE proceed normally, but CU lacks F1/DU link. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "gNBs.remote_s_address=" (empty string) invalid (should be "127.0.0.3" for DU IP), causes OAI F1AP to skip SCTP connection to DU (per OAI f1ap_setup.c expecting valid remote address), preventing F1 setup and radio activation. GTPU bind fails on invalid IP "192.168.8.43", SCTP on NGAP fails similarly. External knowledge: OAI remote_s_address defines DU IP for F1; empty/invalid causes connection failure. 3GPP TS 38.470 requires valid F1 transport addresses. Root cause: empty remote_s_address prevents F1AP connection to DU, blocking F1 setup and AMF association despite DU/UE readiness.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Update cu_conf gNBs remote_s_address="127.0.0.3" (valid DU IP). Also correct du_conf rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Debug: Check OAI code for remote_s_address usage (grep remote_s_address in f1ap_setup.c). Re-run; expect F1AP connection, setup, AMF associates, PDU session. If persists, verify DU IP. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"remote_s_address": "127.0.0.3"}}, {"du_conf": {"rfsimulator": {"serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"}}, {"ue_conf": {}}. Limitations: Truncated CU logs (ends at NGAP AMF check); no timestamps; assumes empty address causes F1 skip (per OAI patterns).
