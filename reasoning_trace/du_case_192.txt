Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode simulation using rfsim for radio emulation, with CU and DU split architecture. The expected flow is CU initialization (NGAP, GTPU setup), DU initialization (PHY/MAC setup, RU configuration), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE connection via PRACH/RACH (Msg1 → RAR/Msg2 → Msg3 → Msg4), RRC setup, and PDU session establishment. Potential issues include config mismatches in servingCellConfigCommon RACH parameters, invalid contention resolution timer causing RA failures, asserts in RACH config, or connection failures due to timer expiry. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (du_conf) has servingCellConfigCommon with ra_ContentionResolutionTimer: 0 (invalid, should be 1-8 for sf8-sf64), ra_ResponseWindow: 4, etc. ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", serverport "4043". Initial mismatch: ra_ContentionResolutionTimer=0 is invalid per 3GPP TS 38.331 (ENUMERATED {sf8, sf16, sf24, sf32, sf40, sf48, sf56, sf64}), causing immediate timer expiry.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates gNB tasks, sets up threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB. GTPU configures SA mode with address 192.168.8.43:2152 but bind fails ("Cannot assign requested address"), E1AP fails to create CUUP N3 UDP listener. F1AP starts, receives F1 Setup Request from DU (gNB-Eurecom-DU), sends F1 Setup Response, accepts DU with RRC version 17.3.0. Decodes CCCH for UE RNTI 5e1c, creates UE context, activates SRB1, generates RRCSetup, processes RRCSetupComplete, but then "trigger release with 0 pdu", "removed UE CU UE ID 1/RNTI 5e1c". Anomalies: UE context created but immediately released, indicating RA failure at DU.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, configures RU with librfsimulator.so, sets band 78, SCS 1, TDD. RU RF started, UE connects with command line -C 3619200000 -r 106 --numerology 1 --ssb 516. RA procedure initiates with preamble 10, energy 54.0 dB, activates RA process, generates RA-Msg2 DCI, Msg3 scheduled, RA-Msg3 received, but "RA Contention Resolution timer expired for UE 0x5e1c, RA procedure failed...", UE context removed. Second RA attempt with preamble 31, Msg3 received but "No UE found with C-RNTI 5e1c", RA fails again. Links to gnb_conf: servingCellConfigCommon ra_ContentionResolutionTimer=0 used in RACH config, causing timer to be 0 slots, expiring immediately after Msg3.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE synchronizes, decodes SIB1, initiates RA with PRACH, receives RAR, transmits Msg3, "RA procedure succeeded. CB-RA: Contention Resolution is successful.", RRCSetup received, RRCSetupComplete sent, but then "SR not served! SR counter 64 reached sr_MaxTransmissions 64", "Triggering new RA procedure". Repeats RA, receives RAR, transmits Msg3, but no further success. Links to ue_conf: rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1":4043 matches DU RU config, but RA fails due to timer expiry.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU creates UE context after Msg3, but DU expires contention resolution timer immediately due to ra_ContentionResolutionTimer=0, failing RA, causing UE to retry. Misconfigured_param ra_ContentionResolutionTimer=0 invalid per 3GPP TS 38.331, as RA contention resolution timer must be at least sf8 (8 subframes). Hypothesis: ra_ContentionResolutionTimer=0 causes timer to expire instantly after Msg3, preventing Msg4 ACK detection, leading to RA failure and UE retries.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Update du_conf gNBs[0].servingCellConfigCommon[0].ra_ContentionResolutionTimer to 7 (sf64). Debug: Check OAI RA timer code for validation; run with valid timer to confirm RA success. Tools: Use wireshark on F1AP for Msg4. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {...}, "du_conf": {... "servingCellConfigCommon": [{"ra_ContentionResolutionTimer": 7, ...}]}, "ue_conf": {...}}.

Limitations: Logs show RA failure but UE retries; truncated after second attempt.
