Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, as indicated by UE logs showing rfsim client attempts and DU logs with rfsimulator server config. Expected flow: CU loads config, initializes with GTPU/NGAP/SCTP setup, DU connects via F1AP, F1AP setup completes, radio activates, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid IP values causing NGAP bind errors), preventing AMF association, leading to connection failures. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf.gNBs) has gNB_ID=0xe00, gNB_name="gNB-Eurecom-CU", tracking_area_code=1, plmn_list with mcc=1/mnc=1/mnc_length=2/sst=1, nr_cellid=123456789, tr_s_preference="f1", local_s_if_name="lo", local_s_address="127.0.0.5", remote_s_address="127.0.0.3", local_s_portc=501, local_s_portd=2152, remote_s_portc=500, remote_s_portd=2152, SCTP_INSTREAMS/OUTSTREAMS=2, amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=12345 (invalid integer instead of IP string), GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152. ue_conf has sa=1, rfsim=1, imsi="001010000000101", rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043". Initial mismatch: GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=12345 is invalid (should be IPv4 string like "192.168.8.43"), causing NGAP setup failure in logs.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY/RRC/PDCP/SDAP, allocates RRC inst, sets F1AP id/name, disables SDAP, sets DRB count, does SIB23, PDCP init. Logs truncated, no threads or NGAP setup shown. Anomalies: Abrupt end after PDCP, no SCTP/NGAP threads, likely CU crashed or exited due to invalid NG_AMF IP. Cross-reference: Invalid GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF prevents NGAP interface binding.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU loads config successfully, initializes RU threads, sets up rfsimulator, waits for gNB L1, RF ready, client connects (UE), but F1AP connect to CU 127.0.0.5 fails "Connection refused" repeatedly, retries association. No F1 setup, waits for response before radio activation. Anomalies: F1AP failures due to CU not running properly. Cross-reference: DU expects CU at 127.0.0.5, but CU invalid NG_AMF IP causes early exit.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes PHY for rfsim, configures HW cards, starts threads, runs as rfsim client, tries connect to 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly, all fail errno(111) "Connection refused". Anomalies: Persistent connect failures. Cross-reference: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1" matches attempts, but server not started because DU not activated (no F1 setup).

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU fails to set up NGAP due to invalid GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=12345 (integer not string), causes interface binding failure, CU exits early after PDCP init. DU starts but can't connect to CU via F1AP, retries fail. UE can't connect to rfsim server because DU waits for F1 setup, radio not activated. Timeline: CU fails immediately on NGAP setup, DU/UE proceed but fail on connections. Hypothesis: misconfigured_param "gNBs.NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF=12345" invalidates NG_AMF IP parsing in libconfig/OAI code, causing bind failure and early exit. This blocks CU init, cascading to F1AP/UE failures. Guided by misconfigured_param, root cause is invalid GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF type (int vs string), per OAI param validation (expects IPv4 string). No tools needed, logs/code patterns confirm.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Change GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF from 12345 to valid IPv4 string, e.g., "192.168.8.43" (matching GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU for consistency). Debug: Check OAI config_userapi.c for NETWORK_INTERFACES validation, use strace for NGAP socket calls. Tools: If spec details needed, search "3GPP TS 23.501 NG interface IP configuration" or "OAI NETWORK_INTERFACES parameter". Corrected config snippets: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"NETWORK_INTERFACES": {"GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF": "192.168.8.43"} /* Changed from invalid int 12345 to valid IP string for NG-AMF interface */}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}}.
