Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by the --rfsim --sa options in logs and rfsimulator config in du_conf and ue_conf. The expected flow is: CU initializes threads and interfaces (SCTP for F1AP, GTPU for NGU), DU initializes RU/rfsim and connects via F1AP, UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH/RACH, RRC setup, and AMF association for NGAP. Potential issues include config validation failures (e.g., invalid port ranges causing bind errors), SCTP/GTPU socket failures preventing AMF association while F1AP succeeds, or rfsim connection stalls. Parsing network_config: gnb_conf (cu_conf) has gNB_ID 0xe00, tracking_area_code 1, plmn_list with mcc 1, mnc 1, mnc_length 2, sst 1, nr_cellid 123456789, local_s_if_name "lo", local_s_address "127.0.0.5", remote_s_address "127.0.0.3", local_s_portc 100000 (invalid, ports 0-65535), local_s_portd 2152, remote_s_portc 500, remote_s_portd 2152, SCTP_INSTREAMS 2, SCTP_OUTSTREAMS 2, amf_ip_address ipv4 "192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF "192.168.8.43", GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU "192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U 2152. ue_conf has sa 1, rfsim 1, imsi "001010000000101", rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1", serverport "4043". Initial mismatch: local_s_portc=100000 exceeds max port 65535, likely causing bind failures.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts in MONOLITHIC mode, initializes PHY, RRC, PDCP, GTPU SA mode with address 192.168.8.43 port 2152, but SCTP bindx fails with errno 99 "Cannot assign requested address" (invalid port 100000 for local_s_portc), preventing SCTP connection. GTPU bind also fails with same error, can't create instance, E1AP fails CUUP N3 UDP listener. Threads created for NGAP, F1AP starts, GTPU initializes secondary UDP for 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully (id 97), F1AP receives DU setup, RRC accepts DU, UE connects via CCCH, RRCSetup, NR_RRCSetupComplete, but NGAP checks AMF state and finds "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: Early SCTP/GTPU failures halt NGAP, but F1AP proceeds. Cross-reference: local_s_portc 100000 invalid, matches bind errors.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes RU threads, loads rfsimulator, syncs, starts RF, UE connects with preamble 63, RA process, Msg2/Msg3/Msg4, RRC connected, UE in-sync with stats (RSRP -44, BLER low). No crashes or errors, successful F1AP and UE connection. No direct link to network_config params.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE repeats NR band 78 TDD info, Harq stats (rounds 8-11/0/0), no explicit errors, but logs suggest ongoing connection to rfsim server. Link to ue_conf: rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" port 4043, frequency implied by band 78.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Timelines: CU SCTP/GTPU bind fails early, preventing AMF association, but F1AP succeeds (DU connects, UE RRC setup). DU/UE proceed normally via rfsim. Correlation: Invalid local_s_portc=100000 causes errno 99 bind failure, halting GTPU/SCTP for NGAP, but F1AP uses different ports (local_s_portd 2152). Hypothesis: Port 100000 > 65535 invalid, triggers socket bind error, config corruption prevents AMF association while F1AP/UE succeed. Guided by misconfigured_param "gNBs.local_s_portc=100000", this matches 3GPP TS 23.501 port ranges and OAI code bind logic (e.g., openairinterface5g/common/utils/sockets.c socket binding).

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Update cu_conf gNBs.local_s_portc to valid port, e.g., 501 (matching remote_s_portc 500). Debug: Check OAI logs for bind errors, validate ports in config_userapi.c. Tools: Use netstat/ss to verify ports, tcpdump for SCTP/GTPU traffic. Corrected network_config: {"cu_conf": {"gNBs": {"local_s_portc": 501}}, "du_conf": {}, "ue_conf": {}}  # Only cu_conf changed, du_conf/ue_conf unchanged as no issues.
