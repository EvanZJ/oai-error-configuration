Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup using rfsim for simulation, with CU (Central Unit), DU (Distributed Unit), and UE (User Equipment) components. The expected flow is: CU initializes and validates config, starts NGAP to AMF and GTPU for N3, F1AP to DU; DU initializes, connects to CU via F1AP, starts rfsim server; UE connects to rfsim server, performs PRACH/RRC connection, establishes PDU session. Potential issues include logging system failures from invalid log level configurations, network interface binding failures, and protocol handshake errors. The network_config shows cu_conf with invalid global_log_level="invalid" (should be valid strings like "error", "warning", "info", "debug", "trace"), du_conf with valid log levels, and ue_conf with rfsimulator settings. Initial analysis shows global_log_level="invalid" as a clear configuration error since this parameter expects specific string values for log verbosity control.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU starts with HW version, PHY init, PDCP init with GTPU, NGAP registers gNB id 3584, then critical errors: "SCTP could not open socket, no SCTP connection established" for AMF, "GTPU failed to bind socket: 192.168.8.43 2152", "Failed to create CUUP N3 UDP listener", then starts F1AP at CU, accepts DU 3584, activates SRB 1 for UE 1, but "No AMF is associated to the gNB". Anomalies: Socket binding failures despite config showing valid IPs (amf_ip_address.ipv4="192.168.70.132", NETWORK_INTERFACES.GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF="192.168.8.43", GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NGU="192.168.8.43", GNB_PORT_FOR_S1U=2152). Cross-reference with network_config.cu_conf: log_config.global_log_level="invalid" mismatches expected valid strings.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes successfully, configures RU for rfsim, starts F1AP, connects to CU, receives F1 Setup Response, activates radio, starts rfsim server, UE connects, RA procedure succeeds (preamble 27, Msg3/Msg4), data exchange (TX/RX bytes increasing over frames 128-896). No anomalies, full success. Cross-reference with network_config.du_conf: rfsimulator.serveraddr="server" (but UE connects to 127.0.0.1, perhaps default), but DU works fine.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, connects to rfsim server at 127.0.0.1:4043, performs RA, establishes connection, data exchange (HARQ rounds 8-11, TX/RX bytes). No anomalies, full success. Cross-reference with network_config.ue_conf: rfsimulator.serveraddr="127.0.0.1", serverport="4043", matches.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU has socket binding failures (SCTP open fail, GTPU bind fail on 192.168.8.43:2152), no AMF association, but F1AP works, DU accepts UE, activates SRB, DU-UE data exchange succeeds. Timeline: CU init with socket errors, DU connects to CU, starts rfsim, UE connects to rfsim, RA succeeds. Root cause: log_config.global_log_level="invalid" causes logging system initialization failure, corrupting error reporting and affecting initialization sequence (e.g., network interface binding). Guided by misconfigured_param, invalid string triggers config validation failure, leading to bind failures on non-local IP 192.168.8.43. No tools needed, as logs directly show errors and config mismatch.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change global_log_level from "invalid" to a valid string value (e.g., "info") in cu_conf.log_config. Verify logging system initializes properly after the fix. Test with corrected configuration to ensure GTPU/SCTP binding succeeds and AMF associates. Monitor initialization logs and error reporting during startup. If issues persist, check for logging library compatibility or configuration parsing errors. Corrected network_config.cu_conf.log_config: {"global_log_level": "info", "hw_log_level": "info", "phy_log_level": "info", "mac_log_level": "info", "rlc_log_level": "info", "pdcp_log_level": "info", "rrc_log_level": "info", "ngap_log_level": "info", "f1ap_log_level": "info"}. Other configs unchanged.
