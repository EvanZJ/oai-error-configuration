Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: The scenario involves an OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5G NR standalone (SA) mode setup with radio frequency simulator (rfsim) for testing, utilizing a centralized unit (CU) and distributed unit (DU) split architecture connected via F1 Application Protocol (F1AP) for control plane and NG Application Protocol (NGAP) for core network interface. The expected flow includes component initialization (PHY, MAC, RRC layers), F1AP setup between CU and DU, UE attachment via Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) and Random Access (RA) procedure, RRC connection establishment, and PDU session setup. Potential issues to look for include configuration mismatches in PUCCH parameters (e.g., invalid pucchGroupHopping values disrupting RRC encoding), assertions or encoding failures in RRC configuration cloning, GTP-U binding failures due to IP address issues, or AMF association problems preventing NGAP connectivity. Parsing the network_config JSON: The gnb_conf (DU config) includes servingCellConfigCommon with pucchGroupHopping set to 3, which is atypical as this parameter represents PUCCH group hopping mode and should be an enum (0=neither, 1=enable, 2=disable); other params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ra_ResponseWindow=4 appear valid. The ue_conf specifies rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043" for simulation, with IMSI "001010000000101" and NSSAI SST=1.

Analyzing CU Logs: The CU initializes in monolithic mode with NFAPI, creates threads for SCTP, NGAP, GNB_APP, RRC_GNB, and GTPU. It registers gNB[0] with ID 3584, checks AMF state, configures GTPU for SA mode with address 192.168.8.43:2152 but encounters a bind failure ("Cannot assign requested address"), then switches to 127.0.0.5:2152 successfully. SCTP bind fails for F1AP ("could not open socket"), and GTPU instance creation fails, leading to no F1AP or NGAP progress. Anomalies include SCTP socket failure (possibly due to unavailable IP or port conflict) and GTPU bind failure, preventing any F1AP setup or AMF association. Cross-referencing with network_config's cu_conf: The AMF IP is set to 192.168.70.132, and GNB_IPV4_ADDRESS_FOR_NG_AMF is 192.168.8.43, but SCTP uses local_s_address "127.0.0.5" for F1AP; the bind failures indicate network config issues, but the primary issue is DU-side crash preventing F1AP.

Analyzing DU Logs: The DU initializes with NFAPI, sets up L1, MAC, RRC, reads ServingCellConfigCommon (PhysCellId 0, ABSFREQSSB 641280, DLBand 78), configures MIB, frame params, and common parameters. It attempts to clone PUCCH config but fails with assertion "Assertion (enc_rval.encoded > 0 && enc_rval.encoded < sizeof(buf)) failed!" in clone_pucch_configcommon() at nr_rrc_config.c:102, stating "could not clone NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon: problem while encoding", then exits execution. Crash point is immediate after RRC config reading, before any F1AP or RU setup. Anomalies are the encoding failure and early exit. Cross-referencing with network_config's du_conf: Params like prach_ConfigurationIndex=98, ra_ResponseWindow=4, pucchGroupHopping=3 are present, but pucchGroupHopping=3 is invalid.

Analyzing UE Logs: The UE initializes with rfsim client mode, configures HW for 8 cards (sample_rate 61440000, duplex TDD), sets frequencies to 3619200000 Hz, creates threads for UE, L1_UE_stats, TASK_RRC_NRUE, TASK_NAS_NRUE. It attempts to connect to rfsimulator server at 127.0.0.1:4043 repeatedly but fails with errno(111) (Connection refused), indicating the server (DU rfsim) is not running. No connection attempts succeed. Cross-referencing with network_config's ue_conf: The rfsimulator serveraddr "127.0.0.1" and serverport "4043" match DU's rfsimulator config, but DU crash prevents server startup.

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: Correlating timelines: DU crashes immediately during config cloning (assertion in clone_pucch_configcommon), preventing RU init, F1AP setup, or rfsim server start; CU initializes but fails SCTP/GTPU binds, waits for DU (no F1AP received), cannot proceed to NGAP; UE repeatedly fails rfsim connect since server not up. Guided by the misconfigured_param, pucchGroupHopping=3 is invalid as PUCCH-GroupHopping is an enum in 3GPP TS 38.331 (0=neither, 1=enable, 2=disable); value 3 causes ASN.1 encoding failure in clone_pucch_configcommon, triggering assertion and DU exit. Hypothesis: Invalid pucchGroupHopping=3 disrupts NR_PUCCH_ConfigCommon encoding, halting DU init and cascading to CU F1AP failure and UE connect failure. Using external knowledge: Per OAI code (nr_rrc_config.c asserts on encoding failure), and 3GPP TS 38.331 (PUCCH-ConfigCommon pucch-GroupHopping enum 0-2), 3 is out-of-range, causing enc_rval.encoded <=0.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Change pucchGroupHopping from 3 to 0 (neither) to enable valid encoding. Debug steps: Check OAI logs for encoding errors; validate enum values against 3GPP specs; run DU alone to isolate config issues. Tools: Use ASN.1 decoder for PUCCH config; grep OAI code for pucchGroupHopping usage. Corrected network_config JSON snippet: {"cu_conf": {...}, "du_conf": {"Active_gNBs": ["gNB-Eurecom-DU"], "gNBs": [{"servingCellConfigCommon": [{"pucchGroupHopping": 0, ...}]}]}, "ue_conf": {...}}.

Limitations: Logs show DU crash clearly, but CU/UE logs are truncated; no full error traces for binds; assumes pucchGroupHopping=3 causes encoding fail based on param and assertion.
