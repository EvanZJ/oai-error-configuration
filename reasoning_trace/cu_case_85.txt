Overall Context and Setup Assumptions: This is an OAI 5G NR SA mode setup with rfsim simulation, as indicated by GTPU SA mode and UE rfsim client connection. Expected flow: CU initializes, binds GTPU/NGAP interfaces, connects to AMF via NGAP, sets up F1AP to DU, DU activates radio/rfsim server, UE connects via PRACH/RRC/PDU session. Potential issues: Invalid drb_ciphering causing config validation failure, CU crash, F1AP failure, DU connection issues, UE rfsim connect failures. Network_config parsed: cu_conf has drb_ciphering="maybe" (invalid, must be "yes" or "no"), which matches misconfigured_param "security.drb_ciphering=maybe". du_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="server" (mismatch with UE's 127.0.0.1). ue_conf has rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1". Initial mismatch: Invalid drb_ciphering likely causes config validation failure, CU crash.

Analyzing CU Logs: CU initializes in MONOLITHIC mode, creates threads, starts F1AP at CU. Then "[RRC] in configuration file, bad drb_ciphering value 'maybe', only 'yes' and 'no' allowed". Anomalous: CU crashes immediately due to invalid drb_ciphering, no further init. Cross-reference: drb_ciphering="maybe" invalid, causes validation error in RRC config.

Analyzing DU Logs: DU initializes fully, starts F1AP at DU, tries SCTP connect to CU (127.0.0.5), but "Connect failed: Connection refused", retries many times, "waiting for F1 Setup Response before activating radio". No crash, but stalls waiting for CU. Links to network_config: gNB_ID valid in du_conf.

Analyzing UE Logs: UE initializes, tries connect to rfsim server 127.0.0.1:4043, but "connect() failed, errno(111)" repeatedly. No connection, because DU hasn't activated rfsim (waiting for F1 Setup). Links to ue_conf rfsimulator serveraddr="127.0.0.1".

Cross-Component Correlations and Root Cause Hypothesis: CU crashes on invalid drb_ciphering="maybe" (not "yes" or "no"), validation error in RRC config. Timeline: CU exits → F1AP doesn't start → DU SCTP connect fails, retries, waits for F1 Setup → no rfsim server → UE connect fails. Hypothesis: drb_ciphering must be "yes" or "no"; "maybe" causes config validation failure, CU exits, cascading to DU/UE failures. Guided by misconfigured_param "security.drb_ciphering=maybe", root cause is invalid drb_ciphering causing CU config validation failure and crash.

Recommendations for Fix and Further Analysis: Fix: Set drb_ciphering to "yes" or "no", e.g., "yes". Also fix du_conf rfsimulator serveraddr to "127.0.0.1". Debug: Check config parsing for security params; use grep_search on OAI for drb_ciphering validation. Corrected configs:

{
  "network_config": {
    "cu_conf": {
      "security": {
        "drb_ciphering": "yes"
      }
    },
    "du_conf": {
      "rfsimulator": {
        "serveraddr": "127.0.0.1"
      }
    },
    "ue_conf": {}
  }
}
